"bdreggors","June 2000"," One of my current favorites is the Lexus IS commercial where the guy blackmails his boss with poloroids. Quite funny!My least favorite right now is the ""My Toyota"" one. That cheesy song remake gets on my nerves. "
"markz2k","June 2000"," What's the deal with the Dog family in the Odysey commercials? I've never heard them, cause I always videotape everything I want to watch so I can skip the commercials later. Are they trying to say the Odysey isn't good enough for people, only dogs should drive it?  I always try to avoid companies with obnoxius commeercials, but I just bought a 00 Accord anyway. (I don't want my money going to finance more commercials that are annoying to me.)For that reason, I haven't been to a Taco Bell since they started using that stupid dog a few years ago. Anybody else have an opinion on the Odysey commercial? "
"roadroach","June 2000"," The whole point of commercials is to get your attention. They don't have to be relevant. I also find that whole series of commercials to be kinda stupid (even though it looks kinda sorta cool).When the new Tundra came out, Toyota ran a commercial where they lined up the truck against a Lotus at a drag strip....of course the truck was losing....until they hit the dirt road at about 1/2 track. That was kinda different... "
"markz2k","June 2000"," Yeah, I agree the point is to get your attention, but it can easily backfire and turn customers away from buying your product. (Like me and Taco Bell)Never saw the Tundra commercial, but it least it was relevant to the product. If the Accord hadn't been the best choice for me, I might very well have been swayed AWAY from Honda by those commercials. Not that the other manufacturers are any less obnoxious, just don't remember seeing one that was. "
"bdreggors","June 2000"," I've noticed two fallicies in Hodna commercials:1) The Accord Seminar commercial. The speaker says to ""Close your eyes...and picture yourself as this"" and the screens show pictures of Accords. But how can you see what it is if you close your eyes? 2) The Civic gas pump commercial. It's supposed to convey how fuel efficient the Civic is, but it shows a digital pump screen with the ""clikity-clack/ding"" sound of an analog pump.This either says that Honda needs to analyze their commercials more before sending them to the TV stations, or I watch waaay to much TV! "
"floridian","June 2000"," The Camry commercial that says over and over that the Camry is too sexy for-------- God, that is irritating. How could ANYONE call a Camry sexy to begin with is beyond me. Throw that tape in the dumper!!Floridian "
"fezo","June 2000"," Absolutely! Next Chevy will advertise sexy Malibus!I absolutely detest the Toyotathon ads when they run. Does anyone still go to a car dealer because of a splashy campaign like that - ""oh, it looks like a lot of fun at the car dealership - let's go..."" Please! "
"bdreggors","June 2000"," That's an oxymoron  "
"microrepair","June 2000"," is TOTALLY irritated by those Toyotathon commercials they run every month touting their ""Only 3 days left to get these big reductions""!!What they mean is 3 days to the next one... And when have you ever seen 30 people milling around and running back and forth from one car to another in a dealer's showroom. Unless it was a couple of families with totally undisciplined kids.!!What has any of that got to do with the features or quality of their cars??? I agree that one of the few ads of Toyota's that is any good is the Tundra going off the dragstrip into it's off-road mode.. "
"andrew21","June 2000"," ...the new ""zoom zoom zoom"" campaign by Toyota? I find it kinda catchy. But I suspect it's going to be real irritating when I hear it for the 15th time.I like that BMW commercial where it shows one of their cars w/ a musical pattern being ""written"" by the engine note. Kewl.I like the Porsche commercial for their Porsche Experience school. Very kewl. "
"roadroach","June 2000"," I'm starting to get a little irritated by the Chevy Monte Carlo adds with the Tazmanian Devil. First off - there's nothing wild and unrestrained about the freakin' car (unless you count the drugs the stylists were obviously on when they pinned the whole sorry thing).They've also been running the ads lately with Jeff Gordon in them.....ok, I guess I can see the tie in......except the NASCAR version of the Monte and the street version have nothing, zero, nada, zilch in common. "
"roadroach","June 2000"," Remember the Ford Focus commercial when it first came out? (Focus sitting in front of nightclub, music pumping, line of people waiting to get in). Yeah right, I can just see some hip-hop, gangsta rappa and his ladies partying in a.......Ford Focus. Ooooooookay..... "
"roadroach","June 2000"," I like the VW commercial where the guy parks at the grocery car, walks out of frame, grocery cart rolls towards car, and guy SPRINTS back into frame to tackle the cart. Ouch, thats gotta hurt. "
"liufei","June 2000"," The nissan commercial with the pigeon squadron bomb a nissan from a few years back.... I always got a knack when the pigeon said ""mayday"" at the very end....  "
"fezo","June 2000"," I'll hate myself for asking, but what do people think of the Toyota ""TV guy"" ads?There's a couple with some cute touches but in general they are really annoying! "
"bdreggors","June 2000"," Yeah, shouldn't he have a gold-plated Olds?I thought those Century commercials with the ""Buick Guy"" were good. Made me laugh on a few occasions.The Nissan Frontier ads with that Jerry guy were pretty stupid. ""Putting 4 real doors on a compact pickup was a no-brainer."" Four huge doors and a huge cabin yet a Sliverado extended-cab has more room...It just proves that Nissan designers have no brain!The Toyota Avalon commercial struck me as really annoying. ""Do you really need 64 crayons in a box?"" Do we really need another bad Toyota spot? "
"teo","June 2000"," I absolutely dislike:* Acura commercials (They used to be good way backin the late 80's)* Cheap Ford Commercials (South Florida Ford dealers)* All Toyota ads* Nissan commercials (Specially the Xterra and Maxima) The annoying ""Cars like it ====?"" "
"kevm14","June 2000"," I happen to get a big kick out of those Maxima ads. Too many people are unconcerned about performance, which the Maxima serves to improve upon in the mid-size sedan segment. I drive a 96 SE 5-speed myself, so when I see all the speed references, handling references, braking, mileage, or what have you, I know it's real.And when it says cars like it - 0, well, how many midsize 5-speed sedans are there that come completely loaded, and even 17 inch wheels for under $30k (SE)? (well under $30k)That's my point. yeah, there are plenty of cars like the GXE - I happen to hate the GXE (or really the fact that people bought it over the SE!!).And this I can say - if you drove a 2000 SE (or even a 95-99 SE) and didn't like it, that doesn't mean the car isn't good. It probably means you do not value performance at all (did you drive to the dealer in a 4 cylinder camry or accord, by any chance?) "
"bdreggors","June 2000"," I think that the Maxima is a good car, but I walked away with a Regal GS. That sucker can MOVE with the supercharger! I'd say that those cars are each other's only real competition. I definetly respect the Max...Well, now that I've plugged Buick, I'll move on.Toyota seems to have made only a few good ads (like the 'Everyday' ones), one of which was where the guy who's busy with everything gets out of his Corolla and falls down the open manhole.I also love the Mercedes S-Class commercial where the Mercedes people are hallmarking the COMAND system; i.e. ""if you are lost, we'll find you directions."" The last part was where a Mercedes guy said ""if you forget your wife's anniversary present...your screwed!"" I laughed a lot at that one. "
"markz2k","July 2000"," I know exactly what you mean about the carls jr. ads. I used to go there at least 3 times a week before they started the sloppy/gross ads several years ago. I haven't been to a Carls for at least 3 years, and they're all over the place here in Irvine. Co-workers hate it if I drive to lunch cause I won't go there. (And won't go with them if that's where they're going!)Won't go to Taco Bell either, those commercials are probably even more annoying than the carls ones.I actually emailed a comment to carls from their site once a few years back. I got a reply from someone in marketing who was pleasant about the issue, but basically said we're happy to lose a few hundred/thousand customers who don't like the ads to gain the several thousand that do like them.And then there's the ULTRA-ANNOYING ads for Cerritos Auto square with jim varney (the Hey, Vern guy) That idiot is the only reason I need to never come close to shopping there. Yes, they got me to remember the name of their shopping center with the obnoxious ads, but they also got me to remember the ads are so obnoxious that I will avoid shopping there at all costs! "
"rickabt","July 2000"," Jim Varney died last year from cancer, but he still appears in commercials for this area's largest Chevrolet dealership ... rest his soul!I've heard that he has appeared in commercials for many dealerships all across the country. I thought there was a law saying that spokespeople should use the product or service offered by the company they advertise ... Jim Varney must have a lot of cars, I guess.I never understood the appeal of Jim Varney for a car dealership unless the dealer wanted to stimulate a response from people with bad credit.Fran Tarkenton also speaks for a subprime-level (caters to sufferers of bad credit) lending institution called Bar None ... does that mean that Fran's financing his car at 21% interest, too? "
"rickabt","July 2000"," Ever since VW's catchy quirky ads have met great success, several other car manufacturers have hired similar-minded ad agencies to appeal to my age group. For example...1.) Ford Focus hatchback ad where the fashionable young passengers exit through the hatch while the Pet Shop Boys sing ""I know it's gonna be alright.""2.) Toyota Echo ad which features the slogan ""Is there an echo out there?"" Lotsa techno music in the background and idiot-with-Mac airbrush graphics ... this is just like the ""Turbonium"" spots from VW. Ever since the Jetta wiperblade-synchronicity spot, there has been a lot of techno music on TV ads.3.) Toyota RAV4 commercial which features the song ""What Do I Get?"" by the Buzzcocks. C'mon, Toyota ... what's next from you? Johnny Rotten singing ""I am an anarchist/I am an antichrist!"" while revving up a Celica GT-S? Punk rock has no place in selling Toyotas!!! In the early 90's, Subaru tried to use punk rock to catch on with young buyers (""Defiant and different ... like punk rock, but it's a car!"") but this failed as well.4.) Acura commercial featuring a collage of images and the slogan ""Engineering is our art."" The song used as the background is from a great little-known Boston band called Galaxie 500. I guess the rights to Galaxie 500 songs sell for far less than rights to well-known major-label artists. Good thinkin'! Save money! Sadly, this triumph in tasteful musical direction was followed up poorly by the lazy ""Key Largo"" CL coupe commercials. That song is so vapid and slow, it makes me think that the car is just as slow! "
"markz2k","July 2000"," Speaking of VW, remember their slogan in the early '80's? I do, and they were 100% correct. ""It's not a car. It's a Volkswagen."" Apparently, based on my 1980 Rabbit, the definition of Volkswagen is ""unreliable POS that spends virtually all of it's life at the dealer, starting one month after the warranty ends."" Bitter, who me?  "
"pjyoung","July 2000"," I can't stand the local ads (especially on radio). We've got two dealers in KC (both Chevrolet dealers) who offer the fast talking disclaimer that nobody can understand. They scream their ads, and they've offered the following.1. $99 down, $99 dollars a month. They spend the whole ad touting this, then the fast talking starts and the ""example"" is a 2000 Cavalier with 3 payments of $99 and 57 payments of $350. What happens when the idiots who fall for this suddenly realize it's NOT really $99? Well, we have ad number 2:2. Big Repo sale. Like new cars with used car pricing. Negotiation will not be necessary - the prices on the windows are rock bottom.3. Then they have the Blazer ads, where the deals are for GM employees only. 4. The latest ads are the ""you waited"" as in, we said $99 a month, but YOU WAITED. We had a REPO SALE but YOU WAITED, We had Blazers for $4,000 off, but YOU WAITED. NOW - NO REASONABLE OFFER WILL BE REFUSED. Of course, they don't say what a reasonable offer is.I hate these ads. "
"wenyue","July 2000"," Lexus, unlike their cheaper Toyota breathern, seems like alway make good commericals.I like the IS300 commerical where the guy black mail the boss. Like the ES300 commmerical with a guy driving around a glass building trying to charm himself (like the music especially). GS commericial with the guy messing up his shirt and putting on lipstick trying to fool his wife....Toytoa could learn a thing or two from Lexus commericals. "
"andrew21","July 2000"," The Viper one w/ ""Magic Carpet Ride"" playing. I'm no Viper fan, but I thought that one was fun to watch.Other than that and a few that I mentioned before, I really don't have many opinions on car commercials because 99% are so forgettable. If you asked me 10 minutes after I watched one, I just wouldn't be able to recall the model or even the manufacturer. Yawn. "
"fezo","July 2000"," I don't know - I suppose you are right for the most part, but it just strikes me that Toyota has consistantly annoying commercials. Now if they advertised cars like they do beer, you could tell something from the ads. My personal observation there is the worse the beer the better the commercial. "
"jimveta","July 2000"," These are some I like just because they look cool:- The Chevy Tahoe ads for the previous model year (I haven't seen anyone for the new ones); the series with the morphing nature scenes, the adventures percussive music, and ending with the guy's deep voice ""..like a rock"". i thought the whole series was beautiful and sort of ""awe inspiring""- Tundra commercial where it starts out with just its frame and wheels on a desert flat, and as it moves alongside various vehicles and a train, all the parts fall from the sky to come and  assemble together to form the truck. reminds me of the borg somehow- VW's Vapor color beetle commercial.. just seemed really laid back, cool, relaxing ..- A single dodge ram commercial of it rotating on a pedastal, morphing into different  configurations, representing it's uses with  various company logos on the truck and such.. probably strange of me to like it, but i think it was the style.. simple, concise message, and good deep, moving non-cheesy music.- BMW commercials i think it was the 3-series..  just it carving the corners, intermittent  messages, no talking, good pumping techno. "
"dbakalar","July 2000"," The VW commercials of late are by far my favorite. I like the one from a few years back w/ the two guys tooling around town, pick up the ratty looking recliner chair, only to stare at each other and set it back out on the curb. My all time favorite is the ""Mr. Robato"" commercial for the new Golf. Only because I have been guilty of doing the same thing in my '99 Golf. Nissan Maxima commercials are cool only because of the cool music. The cars themselves are ugly as sin.Stupidest commercials I've seen yet belong to Hyundai. A stage diving Hyundai, and the one with the guy sunbathing in his car, next to the pool, on TOP of a highrise building. Give me a break. "
"vqzhtr","July 2000"," Like em1) Any of the 2000 Maxima, Xterra, and Pathfinder commercials (with out the Jerry Guy). The Maxima commercials because of the upbeat music, the desert shots and because you get to focus on the car and not have to see or listen to some people in the background who you don't really care about or really have nothing to do with the commercial. The Xterra ads because of the cool rugged shots and the Lenny Kravitz song. The Pathifinder commercial that was cool was the one where a whole bunch of Pathfinders are playing polo, that must have been hard to coordinate.I also like the old commercials with the Z and Barbie doll and the birds chasing the Maxima.2) The 1999 and 2000 Infiniti commericials although they may be forgettable. I think they bring more sense of luxury than most of the other luxo companies.3) The BMW X5 commercials. They seem kind of corny with those people jumping in the creek, but I love those shots of the X5 in the woods. 4)Lexus commercial when the cop and and the owner of the RX switch places.5) The Jaguar S-Type commercial (not the new one)6) The VW Beetle Vapor commercial and The Jetta Commercial when the guy saves his car from the shopping cart.7)The GrandAM commercial where the car is driving through that computerized city.Very Funny and Hate em:1) The Acura commercials I gotta change the channel every time I see the key in the ignition. Key largo? I thought they were suppose to inflict luxury what the hell does driving through a dump in New Orleans have to do with luxury. 2) The Honda commercial with Accord ""Going on Vacation"" it's so stupid it's funny. I don't like those commercials with the Oddy and the Dogs either makes no sense whatsoever.3)The Saturn LS commercials. First the one where the guy in the Accord gets scared of the LS and then at the end they call it a peformance sedan HEHE  me and my friends were craking up for weeks. The second one where the guy in the office says he bought a luxury car and then a saturn LS shows up. Funny again.4)The Crazy VW Cabrio commercial thats 5 minutes long.5)Those Mitsubishi commercials cause their all in black and white. and Finally Toyota Commercials All boring and dumb just like the company. Don't get me started on their local ads either, I could have sworn in one of them the 4runner was going to tip over a cliff and fall. "
"bdreggors","July 2000"," The Good:-That 2000 GMC commercial where the Yukons drive around in formation. I love that music! Here's a tip for all the car companies out there: Formation driving gets attention!-The new Dodge commercials, where all the cars are graced with rebates, except the Viper. It's weird, but cool.-Cadillac DeVille and Seville commercials. Nice cohesion between graphics and sounds.-Saturn LS comemrcial with the crazy Accord guy. I don't like it for the Saturn, but because I know that half of all drivers can relate to that guy, talking to themselves and secretly challenging others to races when they try to pass.and a few from awhile ago...-Mercedes M-CLass commercial from a few years ago featuring the singing baby. That ranks among my personal top ten!-Buick full-line commercial with that ""Real Car"" ballad. It was kind of long, but good. At the beginning it showed a minivan and the voiceover, ""Is that a car? That ain't no car."" and then an SUV, ""Is THAT a car? Not a real car..."". So true...The Bad:-Infiniti I30 commercial. Not really a bad commercial, but it highlights the retractable sunshade. Not really an engineering breakthrough!-Suburu Outback sedan commercial saying that the sedan has a ""decidedly uptown look"". Huge foglights, giant spoiler...doesn't bring Times Square to my mind.-95% of all Toyota commercials. Just horrible. People would look at a Camry instead of an exploding building? The overused metaphoric tripe in the Avalon commercial? Someone actually taking a 4Runner off-road? These are hillarious...unfortunetly, that's not their aim.And the Annoying:-The absolute, most annoying commercial, EVER:The current MY TOYOTA sale ads. It is the absolute worst ever. The song will drill into your head and stay there!I don't know if these are playing anywhere else in the country, but in Tampa, Florida, we are being barraged by these ads. I turn on the radio: MY TOYOTA! I turn on the TV: MY TOYOTA! Finally, the sale was over...but wait; Turn on the TV and MY TOYOTA! Its been extended! Now I know how Noriega felt... "
"fezo","July 2000"," ""Now I know how Noriega felt...""Yes! Exactly!! Hee hee... "
"ickes","July 2000"," 1. Nissan Maxima on the dry lake bed with the jet engine sound in the background.2. VW Passat Wagon w/ the that cookie is still good under the 5-second rule.Also like the Lincoln LS cut-less commercial with ""WOOD, LEATHER."" "
"dbakalar","July 2000"," Ford Focus coffee drinking, rail road crossing... ""Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. DUDES!) "
"denniswade","July 2000"," The entire VW campaign. They're minimalist, funny, memorable and they all present a characteristic or benefit of the car in an entirely positive way. The Cabrio ad is my favorite of all -- it absolutely captures the magic of driving a convertible in the moonlight. Maximum cool!!!I drive a Toyota (matter of fact, so does my wife and daughter), but I'm witchoo on the ads -- they stink, except for the Tundra ads, which are pretty cool -- especially the one with the big dumpster trying to parallel park.The original GS ads (""Something wicked this way comes"") were masterful in their attempt to dissassociate the car from its put-me-to-sleep Lexus brethren, and the new GS ad with the girl who wants a ""nice caring buy who reads poetry and isn't afraid to pick a flower"" then sees her REAL blind date, is pretty cool too. But the new IS print ads with the weirdo is just dumb. Saatchi and Saatchi needs some new talent........ "
"rcarboni","July 2000"," The Bad:1. The two women fighting for a parking spot in their SUVs. Bad image portrayal and how many Kias did they wreck shooting that one?2. The Lexus guy looking at his reflection while driving. Now I have associated Dork and Lexus as meaning the same thing.3. ""Wider is Better"". Concept is Stupid.4. Cadillac Catera. The caddy that ""zigs""??? No wonder Cadillac couldn't sell these things.5. Honda Odyssey with the dogs. OK......6. Nissan Maxima. It was kinda cool the first 150 times I saw it. Now I'm sick of the Who, and the Maxima.7. Subaru Outback with Aussie guy. Ok, they're not that bad, but they are getting old.The Good:1. Eskimo describing animal tracks declares ""Audi"" after seeing tire tracks.2. Jeep Wrangler being ""created"" on the mountain.3. Tiger Woods Golf School. Has nothing to do with the car, but is good for a laugh.4. Chrysler 300M showing old commercials of 300 product line.5. Honda Insight. They should have put this much thought into the Odyssey ad.6. Jaguar S-type. Great music and images.7. Mitsubishi image ads. You want to deny it, but you know it's true. You buy because of looks.8. The new Passat ads that have people remembering their younger days.9. The Saturn LS. ""That's what I've been saying for years"". Funny stuff. "
"bdreggors","July 2000"," That Paul Hogan guy is making me think that Subaru is AUSTRALIAN!I liked the older Odyssey ad with the members of the family each being represented by a lawyer that wanted something different in the van. Much better than the Frankenstein dog-men.I also like the new Silverado ad where the drilling guy asks the younger kid what he did with his truck and the youngster responds by saying ""I just washed it."" The owner drives it through the mud during the voiceover and at the end a coworker says ""Man's gotta protect his image""!Just an interesting observation about truck commercials:Silverado: ""The Truck""Sierra: ""Professional-grade Trucks""F-150: ""Built Ford Tough""Ram: ""The Burden of Leadership""Toyota Tundra: ""Just enough power for you!""An exercise in modesty or inadequacy?  "
"ickes","July 2000"," Agree with your comment about the ""wider is better"" It is especially stupid since the Intrigue has a wider track than the GP.I saw the Focud ""dude"" commercial yesterday. VERY ""dud"". Ford is trying too hard to be hip.Does anyone get Cadillac's new Fusion campaign. Not much sense there. ""Standard of the World"" was better, even though it isn't true anymore. "
"freddy_k","July 2000"," One of my favourates - judged by the fact that I cracked up the first time I saw it - guy parks his Jetta, the sound of a rolling shopping kart, guy runs through the camera and tackles it before it hits the car. I though it was great.Most annoying: All the new focus commercials playing cheap, cheesy music and people driving the cars all happy and stupid. Makes me ill! "
"denniswade","July 2000"," You have ""youth marketing"" to thank for that -- kinda like old white guys trying to be ""hip with all that jive""........ "
"crkeehn","July 2000"," Any Sesame Street fan will recognize the Honda dogs as the Wegman Weimaraners. They are used on Sesame Street both dressed up as they are in the Honda ad, and forming letters. "
"timothyadavis","July 2000"," And, from Honda's point of view, I think that spells, ""We are selling all the Odysseys we can make as fast as we can make them, so we can do anything we like in the ads because they don't really have to sell the van anyway. So there!"" Personally, I think the ad directors saw a unique opportunity to spend some already-budgeted ad money on their wild and creative whims since the ads didn't really have to get results other than some attention and possibly an ad award (I forget what they're called, Addy maybe?).... "
"crkeehn","July 2000"," That may well be, but what else can you say about the Odyssey other than I got mine and you didn't, Nah Nah Nah.Anybody with young children that one would need a van for, probably would be familiar with the Wegman Weimaraners (by the way, I did have to look up the spelling of Weimaraner.) from Sesame Street. As Sesame Street is an illusion, the parental units would make the connection that the Odyssey is also an illusion, most likely those that you think you see on the street are cardboard mockups. "
"mhansen1","July 2000"," Last night, I saw for the first time the ad for the VW Jetta where he parks at the grocery store and walks away; then a shopping carriage comes rolling toward his car and he tackles it so it wont hit the car .... found it hilarious!I also liked the ads for the Jeep a couple years back. Girl is suntanning on the hood at the top of the cliff while the storm cloud is raining over the overlooking city.Very annoying plus I do not get it: the Honda Odyessey and the family of dogs ??? "
"rickabt","July 2000"," Following the semantic dissection of the word ""is"" during the Clinton impeachment trial, Cadillac thought they were free to reinvent the word ""and."" They should have realized that the over-analysis of ""is"" was the final straw for many Americans who were growing weary of the entire proceeding, but it is just like General Motors to become preoccupied with aggrandizing trivial minutiae by attempting to add new meaning to words such as ""driver control system.""Remember the ""Driver Control System"" of the S-10 Blazer three or four years ago? What was that?The driver steers the Blazer with the steering wheel. The driver propels the car at varying speeds by depressing the accelerator pedal. The driver slows or stops the vehicle by stepping on the brakes. Except for cars specially equipped by driving instructors, what car doesn't have a ""Driver Control System.""Of course, GM meant that the Blazer had eight available suspensions (of which, I only saw two on the dealership as a Chevy salesman), EVO steering (electrically variable orifice which constricts at higher speeds to restrict the flow of steering fluid), ABS brakes, VORTEC V6, and virtually everything related to the powertrain and safety systems.Many customers actually seemed to be befuddled by all the suspension choices. It actually seemed to backfire on account of this.Strangely enough, the ""Driver Control System"" was not mentioned in the GMC Jimmy ads. "
"rickabt","July 2000"," ""Wider is better"" has already been mentioned, but what about the Pontiac Gran Am's ads which tout the vehicle's ""Solid-Form Contruction.""Is that what makes Pontiacs so different?If I'm not mistaken, steel has undergone a phase change by the time it is forged. It was indeed a liquid at one time.""Stabilitrak 2.0"" is another pompous pile of B.S. How many consumers will ever understand the different components of this not-so-unique system? As an automotive sales professional, it is my job to become familiar with the features of competitive vehicles, but I will choose to ignore ""Stabilitrak."" I suspect that the entire TV-viewing public is snoozing on this.Of course, it is so ridiculous when you hear manufacturers proclaim these ridiculous patented ""systems"" with trademarked names as exclusive options (e.g., ""...the only car in its class with 'Stabilitrak 2.0.'"").Wife: ""I just don't see why we should pay $1500 more for this car compared to the Acura.""Husband: ""Yeah, but does the Acura have 'Stabilitrak 2.0?' I don't think so!""Wife: ""Oh, that's right! That's a good call. Where do we sign?""How plausible is this? "
"bdreggors","July 2000"," ...""Best in class"" crap. Infiniti's I30 (expensive Maxima) has the most powerful V-6 (227hp) in its class, which is entry-luxury or something like that. But what about the Buick Park Avenue with 240hp? Or the Chrysler 300M with 253hp? Those strike me as entry-luxury ($30-40K).So is it BS? Sure is, but its not exclusive to any one company.And one word about the ""Wider-is-Better"" thing. Of the three GM W-Body cars (of which GP is one), which is the widest? The Grand Prix, right? Nope. The Regal? Close...it's the Olds Intrigue!Another thing that annoys me is this sponsership crap. A Coach Edition Lexus? A Nautica Mercury Villager minivan? Who buys this crap??Plus, I've noticed that any car is now a sports car if it has a spoiler and the word ""sport"" in its name. And I mean ANYTHING, take the Dodge Caravan Sport for example... "
"rickabt","July 2000"," I really hate the ad from Mitsubishi in which they cite Car and Driver's choice to name their Galant as the top midsize import above the Accord or Camry; they childishly gloat ""I'm better than you are"" in a tone reminiscent of an overly ambitious, super-competitive playground hoopster ... a hero in his own mind who would wilt under the pressure of real organized competition.I think the viewing public understands that Car and Driver's awards really mean nothing ... after all, the Chevy Malibu was the ""Car of the Year"" in 1998, but long-term tests from other mags have proved that this car is far worse than average.I wonder what kind of people actually respond positively to this ad. Mitsubishi is probably marketing itself to sufferers of ""small-man syndrome."" "
"bdreggors","July 2000"," I actually got a laugh out of it (since I'm not a fan of the Accord or Camry), but I don't put much stock in it. Personally, I'm getting sick of these superlatives.Mitsubishi is the fastest-growing Japanese car company.Toyota Camry is the best-selling car in America/F-150 the best-selling truck.Honda Accord is the most stolen car in America.Only one of these makes a difference to an educated consumer. I'm also sick of the ""Car of the Year"" awards. The Lincoln LS was undeservedly the car of the year. Personally, a car like the S-Class or DeVille deserved to be. They set the standard in their respective fields while the LS is a Lincoln catch-up.Just a little reminder; the Chevy Caprice and the Renault Alliance were also Cars of the Year... "

But it wasn't just the Caprice, it was the LTZ. Here are some quotes from reviews:""The watchword for the LTZ is ``heavy,`` as in heavy-duty stabilizer bars front and rear, heavy-duty springs, heavy-duty shocks, heavy-duty rear brakes (anti-lock system is standard), heavy-duty radiator and transmission oil cooler, and heavier-gauge frame and body mounts.""""Motor Trend magazine named the LTZ its 1991 Car of the Year. The magazine dubbed the car ""a new benchmark in a high-quality, performance-oriented family sedan.""""""The big wheels and tires made the power-steering effort just a bit heavier. But this contributed to the feel of the wheel. When you threw the car into a fast corner, it acted as if it were nailed to the pavement.""""A SPORTY CAPRICE is right up there with talking horses, flying cows and chess-playing chickens on the list of things that don't exist. But there is a Caprice that is sportier than the rest.""""Many people (including me) laughed when Motor Trend magazine named the Chevrolet Caprice Classic LTZ its Car of the Year.The fact is, if you laughed at the Chevy Caprice, the joke is on you. The Caprice Classic LTZ is magnificent in its performance, fit and finish, road manners and handling.""""The LTZ packs two major surprises: performance and handling. It's unexpected when something as unwieldy looking as the Caprice performs as well as it does.""""Rear-wheel-drive cars weighing more than 2 tons traditionally have handled about as well as a barge. The Caprice Classic LTZ is a rear-wheel-drive car that weighs better than 2 tons but can slice through curves without squealing tires and without tossing occupants and cargo from side to side. The LTZ's handling is tight, smooth, predictable and solid.""Here's some from a 93 LTZ review, which had a 350:""Smooth, quiet and powerful is the best way to describe the LTZ's performance. The drivetrain has the same quality feel as a Honda Accord.""""In testing the suspension system, I like to see how well a car drives under duress.

IMHO, the only reason the belated LS was chosen over other redesigned cars was because it was brand-new. I believe that the S-Class or DTS deserved the trophy.

"rickabt","July 2000"," I sense that Camrylev6 has a vendetta against Volkswagen for some reason.I don't sell Volkswagens anymore (so I've nothing to gain from this), but the reputation of below average reliability does not seem to interfere with many VW buyers' decisions because the tremendous improvements are apparent as soon as you look at the car ... and then you drive it, and it is a much more inspiring experience than with Accord or Camry (gosh, and I sell Hondas now ... I hope my boss doesn't read this!!).Advertising is never the sole reason anyone buys anything ... it is merely a reminder that a product is available at a retailer near you.Royal Crown cola (RC, remember?) is still around, but many people born after 1975 probably have no clue. Many people who enjoyed RC as kids also think that RC is out of business. They will continue to drink Coke, Pepsi, and store brands because those are the names that they will never forget ... all thanks to repetitive advertising ingraining the message in your head.Cool car ads bring young adults and nostalgic older adults into the VW showroom with a predisposition toward liking the car ... but the car itself (and perhaps the salesperson) helps to make the transaction complete.As for the ""Pink Moon"" Cabrio ad that I mentioned, the ad was timely (it debuted this spring ... the start of convertible season), and after the overshadowing effects of the phenomenally popular Jettas and Passats, it reminded would-be convertible-buyers that VW makes a fun, cool Cabrio.Now that the VW Eurovan is the only Volkswagen without a commercial, is it any surprise that dealers can only manage to COLLECT these rectangular monstrosities? There is almost no interest in this van ... could it be that knowledge of its existence is equally rare?

Did you have an equally unpleasant situation, or are you basing this on someone you know, or do you have some stats to that effect? I would like to know, becuase I have never heard very many complaints from my VW acquaintances, and I had always considered a VW purchase, especially considering the demand of some models in the used market.Additionally, I'm sick of the new Mazda commercials already.

(Warranty's were 12,000 back then.) Fuse block had failed (common back then, would fail 2 more times over the next year or so) Dealer got VWoA to pay for it the one time. Also had CV joint failures, overheating, sunroof handle broke on first use and other problems I've blocked out.  In short, a lemon. VWoA's position when asked for help? Effectively, they said ""We already have your money, whey would we want to help you now?"" I'll never own another one in this lifetime. Not because I got a lemon, that will happen. Because the manufacturer couldn't care less. I read some of the threads here, and though you MAY be a little less likely to get a lemon, VWoA still doesn't care or try to help. They will if forced to by a lemon law or court, but that's it. (Obviously, not in every case. Some people have had good results from them.) "

"rickabt","July 2000"," It is sometimes very effective for carmakers to mention things like not-so-unique-suspensions as if they are really unique ... if no one else really cares to mention it, then the viewer will also continue to ignore it, and many features--after becoming universally standard--often seem to fade away from public cognizance.I recently sold an Accord to an elderly couple with slow mobility, and one of the things I did right in making the sale was pointing out the passenger-side assist-grip. I noticed that they each had difficult times getting in and out of the passenger seat in the car, so I suggested that they hold on the grip. They remarked that it was much easier, and they continued to remark about it even during negotiations. They had just seen the Camry, but I'm almost certain that the Toyota salesperson failed to mention their assist-grip.Their old trade-in didn't have it, so these folks had no idea that assist-grips have been standard in most midsize cars for years.This is why we are subjected to commercials which sloganeer things such as ""stabilitrak 2.0"" and ""solid-form construction.""

This ad also has a disclaimer which cautions that this should not be tried in real life. In this example, I think Hyundai is hoping to remove itself from the liability if some numbskull decides to drive into such a building.As cars continue to look less and less distinctive from each other, we should expect to see more of this in advertising ... manufacturers want their vehicles to stand apart, so they remove them from familiar scenery of bumper-to-bumper traffic jams and jammed parking lots. Heck, even commercials with parking lots seem to have very few cars ... check the Jetta commercial with the guy tackling the shopping cart, or the Malibu commercial with the sinister shopping cart that's thwarted by the reflexive bumpers.

No expectation, no disappointment, atleast to me.Audi has been on top of my choice for commercials. The new ad is a disappointment. I don't like any of Nissan's commercials. The 'playing Polo' is just another effort to lure buyers like the Kia Sportage versus Suburban ads. I don't care for those commercials. I like the VW Passat ads too, the Golf ads were good too. The Jetta ad on the contrary is another weak effort. First, parking has to be illegal in front of a grocery store (I don't recall seeing a parking space there).Remember Saturn's 3-door coupe ads? The 3-door concept itself got controversial because the third door was being used to allow access to children from the driver's side, that is away from the curb on a 2-way road! In newer commercials, they now show the coupe parked the wrong way, ""on a 2-way road"" (if it were one-way road, I would have no problem). These are some weaknesses in commercials that I notice.

Advertisers know that (most) consumers are smart enough to base such a big purchase as a car on more than just a commercial!I think that this side bar debate on Honda, Toyota and VW matters stems from the merits of the advertising and recent sales benchmarks, not on the qulaity of the cars themselves. VW ads have been successful in bringing in first-time VW buyers. Honda and Toyota ads have not. VW sales are way up. Honda and Toyota are not (or so I have heard). BTW, I own a Toyota and a VW, and I love them both. The Sienna was made in Canada - not one lick of trouble in 24K miles. The Jetta, built in Mexico, equally as bulletproof!

REAL disclaimers like the one on the Hyundai-in-a-building commercial just show how bad this country has gotten. If somebody actually bought a Hyundai and drove it throguh a building like that and killed or hurt someone, that injured person could sue Hyundai...and might win. Look at recent cases: a podiatrist (foot doctor) who tried to help victims at a car crash was prosecuted because he told volunteer EMS that he was a doctor, which he was, but they assumed that he meant a MEDICAL doctor. Also look at the 5 billion (no typo, ""B""illion) settlement against GM, which was later reduced on appeal. Soon, someone will stab themselves in the eye with a pencil and sue Dixon-Ticonderoga for failing to warn customers about the danger of shapened writing utensils. But I prattle on.

I would love to see these cars in 3-5 years when the salt water starts eating away at the undercarriage!I've also noticed that recent commercials picture ONLY that manufacturer's cars in a 'real-world' scene. Examples:*A Yukon XL (or Suburban?) commercial showed a Cutlass and an Astro van as 'background' cars.*In a Buick commercial about 6 months ago, all the driveways had different Buicks.*The commercial for the new Corlla Sport had a Camry (or ES300) and an RX300.*Saturn LS comemrcial showed a Cavalier and a Metro. My theory is that this is intended to portray the LS as the best-looking car there!*Ford (Focus, I think) spot had cabs all around the car; of course, they were Crown Vics.*And in the RX300 commercial where the police cruiser is chasing the SUV, the car is an older Crown Vic, thereby avoiding any association with a newer Ford product, even vicariously.

"fischda","August 2000"," This is a cool topic, and everyone's entitled to their own interpretation and review of car commercials. BUT, as a guy who's worked in advertising, let me give you a few basics about the industry.All ads, cars especially, are targeted to specific audiences. The VW ad with the ""window freak"" is most likely targeted at the yuppie technowizard who has digital surround sound in his living room and a Sony Playstation. I'm being a little presumtuous, but you get the picture. Most of VW's ads fit this profile because this is where they're having the most success! It's called fishing where the fish are. This is usually a reliable way to continue and increase a strong consumer segment for your product. Generating new consumer base is another thing.Remember the tag line, ""This is not your father's Oldmobile?"" That campaign tried to create an entirely new universe of consumers who would never think of buying an Olds. It was a miserable failure because the public saw through it: ""If you have to TELL me this isn't my father's Oldsmobile, then I know damn well it IS STILL my father's Oldsmobile - no sale!""As stupid as you may think VW ads are, bottom line is that they are selling a hell of a lot of cars. I personally identify with a lot of the VW ads (and yes, I bought one). The guy who crashes the shopping cart; the guy who parks at the back of a huge lot away from any other car, even the guy who washes some stranger's Passat in his driveway then runs away. All these ads point to the fact that VW owners are a little different - they identify with their cars. VW's aren't mere conveyances like Corrolas and Accords, they're...well, like family pets! The problem with most critics is that they think too literally. No, it's not realistic that you can park right next to a grocery store, or play polo with your Pathfinder. Who cares!! The point of the message is in the absurd.Back to the geek with the window thing. If you get out of your VW and forget to roll up the windows or something, you don't have to get back in, turn the key, etc... You can lock/unlock the doors, open/close the windows and moonroof from outside with your key in the door - I think that's awesome! So the point of these ads is that VW owner's are freaky over their cars to the point of obsession. Wouldn't you want to drive something that makes you feel that way? Maybe not, but there are many who do. For some, a reliable, uninspiring, same-as-yours Toyota or Honda is the right ticket. But for me, and many others, I want to have fun when I drive, to be inspired, to operate all the cool doo-dads that Germans love to overengineer... The Accord I owned did none of that - my Jetta does, everyday!So, advertising has nothing to do with JD Power, Consumer Reports, whatever. It's all about getting people to check out your product so you can turn a profit! "

Thank you for the insight.

"fischda","August 2000"," I was a history major! Totally useless, but my forray into advertising has been interesting.

But I don't want to buy a Maxima...or any other Nissan. I really loved the old 300ZX ad where the action figure steals Barbie from Ken with Van Halen in the background! I'll tell you what I hate - the Ford Focus ads. But that's because I don't have 12 tatoos and 10 piercings, I guess. "
"timothyadavis","August 2000"," Now that you mention it, I think that all of my favorite ads have been for products that I never owned nor felt any particular desire for. Hmmmmm....

That would go a long way to explain the preponderance of totally rancid local TV ads for furniture stores (""We can save YOU BIIIIIIIIIIIIGGGGGGG if you come down to our moving/inventory reduction/close out/restock/overstock/whatever reason Sale!!!!!"") and the occasional ""shouting"" car dealer....

"rickabt","August 2000"," I don't know which celebrities are selling Toyotas in your neck of the woods, but here in Northern California, Toyota's go-to spokesperson is Steve Young. Following his appearance at the Republican National Convention and several RNC fundraising events, however, it seems that his ads are starting to disappear from the televisions. Perhaps this is on account of the possibly polarizing effect that this kind of political stumping can create.Nationally, the most memorable 4Runner ad I've seen recently depicts a traffic-clogged street below an overbearing concrete canyon with several humdrum gunmetal-grey cars surrounding a bold 4Runner Ltd with a roofrack loaded with outdoor sporting gear (a kayak or surfboard?). A businessman hauling a briefcase back to his office sees the 4Runner outfitted for a weekend of fun and wonders, ""It's Tuesday ... people have to go to work on Tuesday!?!?!""I know that many companies want us to think that all kinds of great things will happen when we buy their products ... usually, the ads try to send us this message that if we wore this pair of jeans or dyed our facial hair with this special formula for covering grey, we can get all these beautiful women like the ones that appear in these ads; but what is this ad trying to tell us? So, if we buy a 4Runner, our bosses will give us more time off from work?Well, if that's true, my only concern is how am I going to pay for this rig if I'm not busy making more money at work? Those Limited models cost about as much as a decked-out Tahoe or an Audi A6. "
"vqzhqr","August 2000"," Are more interesting then whatever Toyota or Lexus can come up with. Toyota commercials, don't even get me started.4Runner has to be the most costly and ugly piece of crap I've seen yet. Why would you someone pay close to $40,000 dollars for a Tacoma with 4 doors it's crazy as hell, not to mention it's not as refined as Pathfinder and doesn't even touch QX4. Pathfinder is the best All around SUV. It's the most refined, a bargin for what you get(unlike 4runner) goodoffroad capabilities, and even has one of the best cargo space. It really has the best of both worlds. Toyota is just riding that image to the max with 4Runner it really isn't worth it for that high price. Why don't they just discontinue it cause no one really wants one.Back to the Topic I happen to think that those New Lexus IS commercials SUCK. They have nothing to do with the car and then those new ones talking about being Better then a BMW not on this planet. Then camry thinking it's sexy, so pathetic. I have to give it to Toyota though for brainwashing a lot of fools. People who buy a Sienna instead of an Oddessey(even Quest is bigger) a Camry instead of a Maxima or Accord. It's a damn shame, it really is. What a waste of money too! "

"2000camrylev6","August 2000"," and on that note... post #126Have you ever looked at a Camry and then an Accord? Except for a few minor differnces in trim, they look exactly alike. The current Camry came out as a 1997 model (been #1 seller since then, BTW) and the current Accord came out for 1998. What does that tell you? Camry came out for '97, the Accord for '98, and look VERY similar. Why? If you guessed Honda copying Toyota, you're right! Copying the best is the only way to COMPETE with the best! I could say this though, Honda builds good lawnmowers!Back to the topic. Like I said before, Infiniti QX4 ads blow chunks! They even show this ultimate POSEUR (excluding the BMW X5) going off road!!!

Of course, from that ad, the couple undoubtedly noted that the redesigned Camry looks almost exactly like an Accord now.

"rickabt","August 2000"," Enough bagging on any car that isn't Toyota ... it's revolting. You've got one heckuva complex about the car you drive. The re-design dates of Accord following the Camry closely is purely coincidental ... all cars are on a five-year cycle to save money these days anyway. Accord had been on a four-year cycle, and the '94-'97 Accord beared little resemblance to the '92-'96 Camry except for its cost of ownership and satisfaction statistics.Camry and Accord still set the standard for reliability and dependability, and that is evidenced in the Mitsubishi ads which name both vehicles as their benchmark before alleging that the Galant is better (whatever).Camry alone sets the standard for sales volume, but it is not a standard that every car tries to achieve, and certainly not the Accord. If Honda really wanted to try to keep up with the Camry, they should just offer rebates. But you know what would happen if they did that ... resale value plummets.Further proof that Honda isn't copying Toyota ... their cars don't ride and drive like hyperbaric chambers on wheels. You can feel the bumps in the road, but you can just as easily and safely swerve around them ... don't try that in a Toyota, just as you wouldn't wanna try it in a Buick.Speaking of copycats, head on over to the ""Who's Copying Who"" forum and see what people are saying about Toyota's Tundra.

I just got a little out of hand about the whole ""Honda copies Toyota"" thing to.Oh and about that ""ride and drive like hyperbaricchambers on wheels"" comment about Toyotas, sounds like something a German car owner would say. You wouldn't by chance drive one, do you Rick? Sounds like a stereotypical comment a German, especially a VW, owner would say about Japanese cars. "

"roadroach","August 2000"," You're confusing ugly with bland. But you have to look at Toyota's mission with a car like the Camry: 4-dr family sedan for the masses. By definition, it will look very conservative (bland). By comparison, VW has set themselves up as, IMHO, the company offering very competant, entry-level Euro sedans. They are trying to offer a little more flash than their Japanese counterparts and so their commercials tend to be much more quirky.Not all Toyota commercials are bad. I like the one's for their Tacoma's ('adrenaline donor program' one is good IMO).Pontiac commercials drive me nuts. What is up with their secret agent Bonneville commercials?

"enigmaone","August 2000"," ""If Honda really wanted to try to keep up with the Camry, they should just offer rebates. But you know what would happen if they did that ... resale value plummets."" So Toyota offers rebates from time to time on Camrys(lease incentives, dealer incentives) and the Camry has exceptional resale value. So your theory is false.  ""You can feel the bumps in the road, but you can just as easily and safely swerve around them ... don't try that in a Toyota, just as you wouldn't wanna try it in a Buick."" Check out the stats! The Accord is no great handler either. Not to mention both are pretty equivalent in their ""handling prowess"". As for Infiniti ads. Gimme a break. They still have the worst ads in the luxury segment. The QX4 ads are a joke: ""the CD-changer has its own suspension...."" etc. My mountain has a suspension to, who cares?

Here is what they've recently advertised:*Rear sunshade*HID lights*Multiple 'suspensions'*QX4 as the ultimate luxury vehicle (right...)*Most powerful [horsepower] V6 in class, which is BS. Class is entry-luxury, right? Technically, the Park Avenue Ultra is entry-luxury, and it has 240-hp. This is the second misnomer that Infiniti has advertised.

"bdreggors","August 2000"," You're right. It was unibody. I forget the actual vernacular.The ad with ""most powerful V-6 in class"" was for the I30, although they did do a later ad with the QX4's engine. "

Then you see a Probe come up behind the sedan, flash its turn signals, and zip past.Next the Probe catches up to a Rolls Royce cruising along with the bumper sticker, ""I'd rather be playing golf."" And once again the Probe changes lanes and speeds by.Finally, the Probe comes upon a slow-moving 4x4 with the bumper sticker, ""I'd rather be doing NOTHING.""

When I tried to inform them only the LE's and XLE's offered the ABS feature, they thought I was up to my doubt-instilling sales techniques.In any event, I'm curious to know how many people cruising around in Pontiac Montana think that they have four-wheel or all-wheel-drive. I just met someone who was curious to know when Honda would begin adding AWD to the Odyssey. When I told them that AWD hadn't even appeared in the rumor mill, they said, ""It's a shame that Honda wouldn't even offer all-wheel-drive when you could just buy a Pontiac Montana.""I tried to tell them that the trend among minivan manufacturers is tending away from AWD (remember that Caravan and Voyager lost this?), but they were quite sure that Pontiac was AWD.Do you think this has anything to do with the Pontiac Montana commercials?

Nissan Maxima commercials, my parents own one : ) But i like the commercials, theyre simple, upbeat and not cheesy. i also think notes made throughout the ad (""cars like it:0"") are smart and true.2. i like the jetta commercial with the guy callin his wife to check out how all the windows can go down if you turn the key..lol its really funny, i can also sorta see myself doing that : )3. the ford escape commercial with activites like ""BIKER"" popping up from a persons real job like business marketing expert or sumthing. 4. the cartoony mercedes C class commercial, actually i like most of the recent benz ads.5. UNIVERSAL CITY NISSAN, that ad is damn funny. its only on power 106 a rap/r&b radio station in LA. the ad just has one of the most loved DJs ive ever heard of ""Big Boy"" rappin and singing with other guys in a real catchy style. at school ive heard more than 10 people singing that song and everyone just laughin along..very effective6. the mistsubishi commericals that tell you ""time for a new car"", i just find them really funny and entertaining.7. the kia commecial where theyre making fun of the Florida ""chad problem"". then they say how theyve been having a chad problem too..next they show 3 old ladies counting votes and then a guy named chad blasts through the door and starts acting like a weird [non-permissible content removed]. it sound stupid, but thats hte reason its funny to me.DISLIKE1. BMW, their ads are too serious and boring..but they werent aimed at my age group, i think?2. pontiac commercials, especially the grand am going thru this metal world. i find that commercial really stuipd, but the musics good.3. all dodge commercials suck, ive seen enough of the red dodge/white background thing.4. im too sexy camry, this has been mentioned in this board before and needs no more explanation lol "
"mateyo","January 2001"," Here in Texas the pickup rules. So every morning during the early news it's either ""Like A Rock"" or Alan Jackson singing about F-150s at EVERY commercial break. Enough already! The commercials do update every so often but the songs have been the same for years.I do like: the Solara convertible ad -- very ummm... nice, and the Camry ""I'm Too Sexy"" ad. Obviously Toyota is being very tongue-in-cheek here and that's what makes it funny. And I find the Aztek camping ad ironic because they use the lead actor from ""Queer As Folk"" in a spot about a romantic adventure weekend with a beautiful woman. LOL. "
"bdreggors","January 2001"," Hmm...now that's a tidbit that you won't find anywhere else...:)I like the commercials for the Suzuki XL-7 depicting the unwieldiness of huge SUVs, simply because its true. "
"ravvie4me","January 2001"," The best commercial is the one that features the collage of Toyota SUVs, with their names (Sequoia, Highlander, etc...) derived from the Land Cruiser, showing Toyota's SUV heritage.The worst commercial is any ChryCo commercial, especially the minivan ones. ""The best minivan ever"" LOL don't make me laugh! Those new one's with the Stratus in the ghettos with those chrome rims are bad to. As someone said before, the bright red on a dull background is kind of annoying. "
"jkidd2","January 2001"," Love:Love the Lexus commerical with the man sleeping next to his new IS in the garage...Love the Lexus commercials with the various idiots driving while eating their breakfast, looking for their CD's, etc...everything but driving....its funny because its so very true!The new Civic commerical with the little boy in the back seat trying to put his legs against his sisters friends....cute...I think its for the M-Class Mercedes where it shows a simulator of a normal SUV driving down the road and constantly hitting everything because it handles so bad....funny.The new IS commercial where its running a rally and then a 3 Series comes around the corner and all the spectators start running to get out of the way of the Bimmer before it slides into them.Hate:Zoom Zoom Zoom....Mazda Tribute...that song got old after the first listen...White rap (or whatever its supposed to be) Dodge commericials...Hard Core Grand Am....""I want a hard core""...with the trendy looking models...ugh..Any Aztec commercial...almost makes me lose my lunch everytime I see one...Mazda Protege commercial with the trendy 20 somethings and the pop/electronic music...almost sounds just like those annoying Dodge adds.If I hear ""Stayin Alive"" one more time while they show flipping M-Class' over and over I am going to do an Elvis and shoot my TV. "
"ravvie4me","January 2001"," good: The new Toyota Tacoma commercials where all the guys pull up in the Tacoma and see bears digging in their campsites. Then they hop out of the truck, go kick the bear's butts and say ""You just can't be messin' with a man's salad. Word up!"" or something to that extent. "
"jkidd2","January 2001"," Back cover of the January issue of Motor Trend is an add for the BMW X5.Just a photo of the X5 going down a road, with the print: Cost: $39,470, feels like: $1,000,000., You save: $960,530.In very small (and blurry) font @ the top of the page it indicates the X5 shown in the photo goes for $50,820!I realize you see these types of adds all the time where they say one price, but the car they show costs more...but the add print is clearly trying to make you believe the X5 shown can be had for 39k. I know its not illegal, but it sure is false advertising...just because everyone does it, doesn't make it right. "
"bdreggors","January 2001"," That's funny! You know, it just goes to show you that listing it as $50K would really dissuade more buyers.Good:Caddy Seville commercial that shows the LeMans racer with a bumper sticker that reads, ""My other car is an STS."" Cute...even though they lost :-(New Civic commercial showing the guy covering his car when he picks up his date and then removing it mintues later.Suzuki XL-7 commercials depicting excessive SUVs...very true and funny, especially when that SUV takes out the traffic light...man, that was good!Bad:Toyota Avalon commercial...is it really necessary to show the same darn commercial incessently??Annoying:Zoom zoom...'nuff said!  "
"bdreggors","January 2001"," Nearly forgot.Annoying:That ""ReVOLVOlution"" crap. Ugh... "
"sonyfocus","January 2001"," where two identical good-looking cars (possibly Passats?) pull up to a traffic light, one driven by an attractive female, one by an attractive male. They look over at each other, make eye contact and smile. Suddenly, a beanie baby or similar toy gets thrown onto the guy's dashboard. The woman in the other car laughs and looks back at the road. Embarassed, he kind of hunkers down looks into his rearview and sees a child, laughing, in the back seat of his car. As the cars proceed through the light, the woman also looks into her rearview and catches the eye of a laughing child who is in a car seat in her own car. I don't remember how this particular ad tied in with actually selling the car, just liked the split second where the toy plunks on the dashboard ending what may have been an innocent flirtatious moment between two strangers.Did not really like the recent VW commercial during the Super Bowl where the two guys were rattling a tree and a red VW dropped down.Personal favorites are the one where the VW is being washed in a driveway but does not belong to the guy who is actually washing the car. The second is the Jetta/grocery cart discussed above. And yes, I own a Jetta and love it, but did not buy it because of the ads. Actually, I only saw the commercials after buying the car.VW definitely has the best current car commercials. "
"hiwaysanity","January 2001"," are repeated over, and over, and over . . . I even stopped listening to the #1 radio station in the Boston Market because of repeat ads. When you can drive for 15 minutes and hear the same ad three times, it is annoying! I wonder if the advertisers realize that they may be reducing their markets by annoying potential customers. "
"ludacris","January 2001"," speaking of superbowl...""What are you doooiing??"" i think that and the monkey from etrade walking thru the ruins of .com companies had to be the best. i especially like the part when the chimp saw the pets.com puppets and a tear fell from his eye hahahaha. the bob dole commerical was pretty funny too. i didnt get either of the VW commercials. the tree and the wedding thing.. "
"bdreggors","January 2001"," I didn't really like the wedding one either. I thought that the tree one was funny, but not THAT funny. Kind of a stretch when you think about it. Then again, I guess commercials aren't supposed to be thought out.To answer your question:Watchin' the Market, drinkin' an import ;-) "
"carlady","January 2001"," The VW GTI in the tree wasn't too bad. The Running of the Squirrels was a hoot. It seemed like this year's commercials were making fun of last year's commercials -- the sock monkey, etc.My far and away favorite ad was the one with Sarah Ferguson for Merrill Lynch. Top of the pops!!! A classic!carladyHostNews & Views and Hatchbacks Message Boards "

"dweezil","February 2001"," ad I've seen,that absolutely caught the entire image of the car, the aspirations of the buyer and just the lush mystique of the car better than any other- The Jaguar ad from 2 or 3 years ago with I believe Etta James in the background singing ""At Last...[our love will come along...]"" with shots of the car gliding by.It got me. Sweeeeet!Worst; The Chrysler 5 Star service ads. OB-NOX-ious.Of COURSE; EVERY Chrysler dealership has a ""strong"" woman running things! When was the last time??? Of course the ""boys"" hop to; no problem! Sexist, unreal, sound is bad. It's almost embarassing.Also liked the Cadillac ads with the current Eldorado passing a 59, and the tag line: ""It's not what's new. It's what's NEXT!"" So much better than ""the power of ""AND"".And WHAT? AND NOTHING! "
"dbakalar","February 2001"," I completely forgot about that commercial! That one was one of my absolute favorites. I also liked the commercial for the new Jag 'S' Type with Sting in the back seat singing. Not sure why he wasn't DRIVING it, but I liked the commercial. I STILL love most of the VW commercials, with the exception of the new GTI falling out of the tree. And is the ZOOM ZOOM commercial finally over? That little kid just ANNOYS me almost as much as the little Pepsi girl. "
"dweezil","February 2001"," I'd like to send them BOTH to their rooms!!!I had an INTENSE dislike for those early Nissan Pathfinder or XTERRA commercials with Lenny Kravitz in the back ground.Maybe I,m just an old f*rt, but they beat that to DEATH...and I hated it more every time it came on! I almost dislodged the ""mute"" button on my remote control trying to turn the sound down.Made me wish for Infiniti's first rocks and trees commercials.[Which actually gave the car a mystery and ""something"" that Lexus doesn't have to this day]-something almost eerie in the way the Tucker was,the kind of surreal peacfulness and completeness of Japanese decorating. Can't explain it, really, but even though it was great fodder for the comics,it sort of gave the thing the air of a resurrected Packard-something REALLY special. [of course it could have just been the soshi [sp?] screens at the display at the Auto Show!!!]. "
"timothyadavis","February 2001"," I think the Jeep Cherokee commercial is great in which the couple arrives back home and exits their totally mud-coated Cherokee. However, before they can reach the front door of their beautiful white house, the Cherokee begins a wind up a la wet dog. As the couple turns to notice, it then proceeds to shake off the mud in spatters all over the couple, the driveway, the surrounding vegetation and the front of the house. The final shot is a remaining glob flicked off with a wiper blade which plops decisively into the man's face. As the camera pulls away you see the now-clean and glistening Jeep in the midst of its cast off mud debris. It may not sell the thing, but it was a brilliant idea.... "
"dweezil","February 2001"," The couple have run up into the woods and stopped to watch a deer.""Honey' get the camera""!She reaches for the camera, finds a big handle like thing and says< ""What's this?""The guy says ""Don't pull it!"", but too late,the inflatable boat explodes and pushes BOTH their faces into the front window, which you see fom a medium shot outside the car.

"greg116","February 2001"," The Pathfinder ad that shows it going UP the ski hill. I want to do that some day. It's actually not too hard if you've got the right tires and enough power.I hate that ""end of the earth"" Ford commercial. Yeah sure like only Explorers can go that far. They shouldnt try going to the other end, cause thats where all the ZR2 people are hangin! "
"markz2k","February 2001"," Those Carl's commercials bug me, too. A lot! I use to go to Carls for lunch 3 times a week, sometimes more. As soon as they started those gross commercials, I stopped, and have only been back 1 or 2 times since. (Only because someone else was driving, and I had no choice.) They've been running those for years, I guess it doesn't bother most people. Even Taco Bell finally got rid of that STUPID dog; I avoided them too. "

"brekke","February 2001"," There was one commercial that followed a long funeral procession with a voiceover of the deceased reading his will.

Cut to a Beetle at the end of the procession, a young guy's driving. He may or may not have been the only one crying.

"spin360","February 2001"," a few months back I was fliping through channels and saw an ad for the Fox family channel. It was a play on a car advertisement, along the lines of ""if kids designed cars."" I only saw the ad twice.. never from the beginning.. so I don't remember it too clearly, but it had a narrator saying things like ""..the luxury.."" while showing a fancy looking brushed aluminum snack bar. Actually the last scene in the ad showed the car (with a huge 3D bunny face plastered on the hood) skiding through a wet asphalt parking lot with its front tires turned in a slide (kind of like those Nissan Maxima ads) throwing water, with the parents in the back seat screaming and the kids presumably up front. I got a kick out of it... but then again I'm easily amused. :-) "
"chevytruck_fan","February 2001"," the latest CRV commercial it says something about deceptive head room where these tall girls think the guys are taller because of the head room in the CRV. My question is, wouldn't this mean that the CRV had no headroom and then would make the guys taller. What were they thinking?Some commercial I like:Of course the Silverado, the new HD series, I just love the commercials where they dump a load of dirt into a truck! Everybody has to admit the Like A Rock is one of the best commercial series of all times, everybody know the song and the truck that goes along with the song. This is an example of what to do right in a commercial. (ties with the Marlboro man and magnificent seven theme)I also loved the Ford Country commercials (ones sung by alan jackson)The new suburban I think is pretty cool, showing the heritage, I like when automakers do this.I liked the saturn commercials when they first came out that included lots of shots of the workers, and the UAW banner, thought this showed guts as an automaker.ALL TIME FAVORITES---Those old Chevy commercials with see the usa in your chevrolet song, with the car turning on the table thing's, I love watching that old footage, man that was awesome. ANd the song, if only a automaker could come out with this now ""drive your chevrolet through the usa, Americas the greatest land of all, on a highway or a road along a levy performance is sweeter nothing can beat her, life is completer in a Chevy""I think commercials with songs do a good job of imaging.BAD BAD BAD COMMERCIALSMazda, zoom zoom zoom is suppose to make me want to buy this, this isn't even brand imaging at all.Retarded.Volkswagon Cabriolet, where they go to a party and decide to drive under the stars, not really bad I just don't like it. And the mr roboto.I Agree with the majority, the dog commercials are retarded for the odyssey, as well as ever Toyota commercial.The newer dodge commercials with the ants and junk, oh man, this is as good as the caddy that zig's, I will add sales have suffered considerably.Chevy commercial with the lady on the bench seat out of the tahoe, I love chevy and I relize this commercial is corny.Bottom line, if you get a song that is fits well it will do wonders for commercials.What do you guys think about my choices? "
"bdreggors","February 2001"," I pretty much agree with your choices, but I did like the 'Mr. Roboto' VW ad and I guess of one of the five people in America that got a kick out of the ""Caddy That Zigs"" campaign (never saw what the controversy was with Cindy Crawford).Didn't think about the CR-V commercial in that way.

And he says ""It is, isn't it?""The second one shows the same guy at some fancy dinner party. He gets up and says ""There's a car in the parking lot with it's lights on; its silver, looks new"" and everyone promptly runs out to see.

"andre1969","April 2001"," I vaguely remember one where a Dodge was towing a Ford and hauling a Chevy in its bed. Or it could've been any combination of the three trucks...seems those ads are always interchangeable!My favorite was back in the mid-80's, when Cadillac and Lincoln got into the size wars over their Brougham and Towncar. Lincoln started off with an ad that showed a rich couple at the country club. The gentleman throws the keys to the valet and says ""the black Cadillac please"". Well, the valet pulls up in a black Olds 98. This was probably 1985, the first year of the downsized C-body, when Olds, Cadillac, and Buick took a lot of flak for attempting to make smaller, better-handling luxury cars. Well, another guy remarks ""Isn't that my Buick?"" Before you know it, the parking lot is crammed with look-alike Electra's, 98's, and DeVilles, with owners fighting and aruging over who's car is who's.Finally, another old geezer comes up and says ""The black Town Car, please"", and the valet finds it immediately. As the Towncar pulls up, all the B/O/C owners stare at it in awe, and we cut to ""Lincoln...what a luxury car should be"".Well, not to be outdone, Cadillac responded to this. Cut back to the country club. Two old geezers are out in front. One asks for his black Town Car, and the other asks for his black Cadillac. The Lincoln guy turns to the Cadillac guy and says ""You know...it's too bad Cadillac doesn't make a BIG car any more.""The Caddy owner replies, ""Oh it's big"". Then we cut to the announcer stating that Cadillac has always built a big car, blah blah blah. Then, when the Brougham finally pulls up, the Lincoln owner says ""Well, it's...pretty big""To which the Caddy owner replies ""Bigger than yours!""Ok, I know this post is getting longer than a Town Car and a Brougham combined, but here's a final one that I remember from the series...We're back at the country club, and the guy that had originally asked for his Caddy and caused all the confusion in the first commercial is back. The valet looks at him, and has a bad flashback chock full of stock footage of the DeVilles and Electras and 98's and their confused owners.Then the geezer this time hand the valet the keys and says ""My NEW Lincoln Town Car, please!"", to which the Valet smiles and sighs relief.I used to think these commercials were pretty funny. I'm surprised that Lincoln doesn't try something like that again. Except now, with the big FWD Caddies being so much larger than those 1985 models, and the Town Car being smaller, I think the Caddy may actually be a touch larger inside.-Andre "
"ineto6","April 2001"," I was thinking about a Jag? commercial where the couple's heads are tilted back. The guy gave the key to the valet and the valet thought that the couple was looking snobbish. But once the valet got into the car and drive.... whissshhh.. his head is tilted backward like the couple. I guess the commercial is saying that the car is fast and has no head restraint  "

I don't like:- any SUV ad that shows the vehicle in the desert, the mountains, the wilderness, etc., since we all know that no one uses them for that anyway. ;-) Since all SUV ads do this, I don't like any of them.- the ""zoom zoom"" Mazda ads- the Aztek ads just for inflicting that ugliness onto the viewing public.- the latest Cadillac ad showing scens from the 50's and 60s is great, until they start showing the current ugly Caddy concept cars with their Blade Runner front ends.

I've always liked DeSotos, but have never seen an old DeSoto commercial. Here's one of my favorite DeSoto ads though...from 1957...It's just so downright rude, that I love it!

"ravvie4me","April 2001"," Actually, it wasn't ball bearings, it was the ""champaigne (sp?) glasses stacked like a pyramid atop the hood while the drive wheels were on a roller and taken up to speed (like some emission testing stations) to show the lack of vibrations"" ad that Nissan copied from Lexus.

Plus the front end of that thing looks like a combo of last-gen Hyundai Sonata and current Toyota Corolla S, but that's another topic.That new Hyundai Tiburon commercial is bad too, but only because the car is FUGLY as sin. Having to look at it is punishment enough (ala Aztek).I like the new Camry commercial where the guy takes his wifes fur coat and washes his black Camry with it.

"andre1969","April 2001"," ...here in Maryland, but do you guys and gals in other regions get the commercials for local car dealers and insurance companies where they have people attempting to rap and dance?I remember this one from the late 80's for an insurance agency that had a bunch of stock footage from a demolition derby from the 50's or 60's in washed-out film stock, and the voice-over was rapping ""You want insurance quick..at a affordable price...'cuz they're kind understanding...and Down right nice"". Try to spit a lot when you rap to it, and you'll get the idea.We have a local Fox dealership that tends to rap a bit too much, as well!-Andre "
"ryanbab","April 2001"," yep we have lantern man and eagle man insurance. Very cheesy commercials.

"ludacris","April 2001"," i like the new maxima commercial with the ""doo do doo do do"" song, i dont know what the name is, just those same words over and over. and the car is watching the sunset, once the sun goes below the horizon the car blasts off and stops again and the car again is watching the sun set. made me proud to have a Max in the family ; )i also liked that CRV commercial with the skiers...that makes me smile everytime i see it. i think i may be going crazy but im starting to like the azteks styling (my lil sis always has) and consequently im liking the commercials more because its the only time i get to see azteks. i live in LA, car city, and ive seen 3 Azteks on the road lol...guess those X-terras took southern cali...oh and one more thing, where the hell did all this redneck pride come from?!? i was watching MTV and they had this thing on NASCAR racing. they interviewed fans and they were the biggest, scariest rednecks ive ever seen. confederate flags flying, n word comin out of all their mouths. they said things i never thought id hear...pretty scary stuff..

So when it came time to consider purchasing a new commuter car I gave Kia the benefit of the doubt, and have now owned two Kias and love them both.I was not comfortable with buying ANY econo-car, but it is what I needed at that time for my long commute. I never showed-off the econo Kia to my friends, yet I thought the car and the price were great. It just wasn't the upscale car I was used to driving.OK, now Kia introduced the Optima. I liked my little Kia enough to check out the new lux-sedan, then bought one. The Optima I DO show-off. I got a chuckle the first time a friend asked if that was my car in the driveway.

I liked that commercial, but Ad Age called the two guys, whom I thought to be roommates, ""ambiguously gay."" That was funnier than the commercial to think an advertising trade would label two actors in a car commercial like that.Now we have the new Hyundai Tiburon commercial with the two guys in the new car wanting to open it up on a twisty mountain road, but they're stuck doing 20 behind a line of RV's.

I really liked the first Kia commercial with the guy admiring his own car...you know, ""It is, isn't it?"" But it got old really fast, and the 2nd one at a wedding is annoying.

Liked that, too.One of the coolest ever, but I can't remember which car (I guess that's makes the ad a failure), is the one where you are constantly changing perspective.

That initial Infiniti guy--he needed to be smacked. I am REALLY sick of the Chevy commercial (Tahoe?) with the models in Alaska or somewhere carrying around the removable seats. Give me a break. The Nissan Frontier -- kicks gluteus maximus? Get that overgrown Tonka piece of crap out of here!!! BTW, I agree that one of history's most laughable ads was the sexy portrayal of the guy in the Camry. What really topped it off was the guys expression at the end. ""Yeah, I deal with this every day. Ho Hum."" "

Also liked the commercials for what I believe was th Suzuki SUV, which obviously parodied Ford's Excurion. Images of a compact 4-door SUV sliding smoothly through traffic and fitting into tight parking spots were interspersed with scenes of the owner of an unnamed jumbo SUV, usually female, performing such daunting tasks as gathering herself for the leap from the driver's seat to the tarmac way below, or jumping up and down in an effort to get a hold of the rear hatch so she could close it. I thought these were very funny and got the message behind the product across very well.Ones that annoy me: Commercials for the new Dodge Caravan, where all they do is mention that it has a sliding front center console over and over and over again. Isn't there ANYTHING else good about the van?Any commercial for front wheel drive vehicles doing power slides.

I think the CL is a much better looking car in person then in photos. Not too keen on the front end of the MDX, but I would take it over an RX300. I'm saving my judgement on the RSX until I actually see, sit & drive it.As for Lexus, I almost salivate every time I come across the SC430, it is tops on my lust factor @ the moment. Love the LS430 and the IS300 (except the taillights). If I were gonna buy a mega SUV, I'd go for the LX470. Never cared for the current generation GS or RX.Toyota?

I'm 35, and I don't have a single friend who's ever even considered buying a Buick. Of course, at my age, my friends are all buying SUV's and minivans.

I particularly liked the ML55 ad with the 5 guys in a huge slingshot, and the ML320 ad with the baby singing ""My Big Bad Dad"" to country music.

A windshield. A locking gas cap. Etc. Is Nissan really trying to market this car to families?

Some of the ones I have include:""For the price of the average new car, you can buy a Hyundai Excel...and a spare.""""Can't put a price on happiness? Try $5195.""""Most cars in our price range have around 50,000 miles on them.""Of course, each of these is accompanied with an equally witty block of text. If only they had been used on a decent car. One other good one, for the Volvo 7-class, shows a 760GLE with a large truck sitting on top of it, and asks, ""Does your car stand up to heavy traffic?"" In terms of modern TV ads, I like the VW Newbeetle ads that explain the architectural value of the arch as a Newbeetle drives up and shows that its shape is the same. I believe ""Round for a reason"" is the accompanying slogan.-Andrew L "

They finally get away from the rhino and come up on an elephant. They then start to get out of the truck.I found the commercial ammusing, but on further consideration I started thinking that it was in questionable taste. It was obviosly a parody of the old highschool/college practice of cow tipping. I have no problem with a little harmless ammusment, but when we went cow tipping we did not drive. Why is this important, you ask? There is traditionally large quantities of alcohol involved in cow tipping. So, by extention, you must assume that the same is true of exotic wildlife tipping. Assuming that this is true (and who would do something so stupid sober?) then you must believe that in this commercial Toyota is promoting drinking and driving. "

What does ""Just Push Play"" have to do with trucks anyway? In addition, I've now seen the Durango ad with the Boxsters that someone else mentioned and it annoys me too. That woman's voice is just aggravating.In Canada they are running a minivan ad that is set up as if they are getting reactions of people leaving a movie theater about the film they just saw and people are yelling ""I love it"" except for an extremely irritating woman who is without words... but the premise is that they have just driven a Caravan, not seen a movie.

Let's just hope we don't have to listen to it for the next fifteen freaking years the way we've had to endure Chevy's ""Like a Rock"". It permanently turned me off all Bob Seger music about a decade ago. I cringe every time one airs.I also agree on the Pontiac ""Pass It On"" series; the people in those ads really, really need to get out more. I haven't seen anyone accept an Aztek yet, though. I do like the VW ads from the last couple of years that were mentioned in earlier posts; specifically the one in New Orleans, the ""Cooper"" one, the one with the smelly chair, and the Golf in the tree. At least they're clever and inventive.A couple more favorites, which aren't car ads but have a racing tie-in, are Dale Jarrett's UPS spots. I like the one where the little kid threatens to hold his breath until DJ races the Big Brown Truck; Dale looks around to see if anyone's watching, then squeezes the kid's cheeks together. The other one is where Ned (Dale's dad) says over lunch, very seriously, ""If you want to race the truck, I'll support you."" Dale says, ""Dad, I'm not racing the truck.""

"windowphobe6","December 2001"," Oddly enough, I had to track them down while doing an essay on, of all things, the return of Bob Lutz. (Disclosure: I am copying from a Web page here, but since I wrote it, I think I can safely say that there aren't any copyright issues to worry about.)Original is at http://www.dustbury.com/vent/vent257.html------------------------------------------Product, we are told, is king. The world will beat a path to your door, rather than to the doors of lesser mousetrap makers. Bob Lutz, who was the guiding light during the glory days of the pre-Daimler Chrysler Corporation, is known to believe this sort of thing, and his arrival at General Motors has been greeted with Second Coming-level enthusiasm. It may even be so. There are few things that General Motors needs right now so much as a line of cars that people will line up to buy without bothering to ask how much the rebates are. For years, GM has been falling back on highly-dubious principles of brand management, figuring that all they had to do was target the advertising correctly, and the targets would duly flock to the dealerships. It didn't take long for the rest of the world to figure out that this strategy was seriously flocked up; by now, even your Aunt Hazel and Uncle Elmer know that underneath it all, a Chevy is a Pontiac is a Buick and used to be an Oldsmobile. Cadillac, once the Standard of the World, has dwindled into a few trim bits here and there. Bob Lutz, say the pundits, will fix all this; under Lutz, the General will presumably build cars that will not only scare Ford and whoever owns Chrysler this week, but cars that will put the fear of God, or at least of Bob, into the hearts of Toyota and Honda and Volkswagen. It's a tall order, and I'm talking Shaq-style height here, but if anyone can do it, surely Bob Lutz can. That little word ""if"" looms awfully large, though. History is full of examples of superior products that died a horrible death in the marketplace. (Two words: ""Sony Betamax"".) The best-laid plans often are royally screwed along the way. I offer as example the small Texas-based television manufacturer, Curtis Mathes, named for founder George Curtis Mathes, which in the late Seventies had a regional reputation that could fairly be described as colossal; their audacious slogan was ""The most expensive television in America, and darn well worth it."" Included in that lofty price tag was a prodigious warranty: one year labor, ten years on parts. I bought one of their 19-inch sets in 1981 for a stiff $500. Twenty years later, it has never needed a repair. The merits of the product, however, couldn't save Curtis Mathes. The rest of the American TV makers moved as far away from Dallas and the rest of the country as possible. Some were swallowed up by international conglomerates; some exist today only as brand names. Curtis Mathes filed for bankruptcy. The company, under new ownership, tried to regroup in the middle 90s under the name ""UniView"" with a WebTV-like box - before WebTV, even - but nothing came of it. UniView still exists, still working on set-top technology and other neat stuff, but what brings in the money these days is, of all things, television - sets imported from the Pacific Rim and sold at Kmart stores under the Curtis Mathes brand. Obviously the ""most expensive"" tag won't play in the land of the BlueLight Special. So I wish Bob Lutz well as he starts whipping General Motors into shape, but I worry that the things he can't control (a soft economy, weird governmental notions, sudden enlightenment at Ford) will wind up overwhelming the things he can. Come to think of it, that sounds like my life. "

Or the people in the Kia com. pulling off to the side of the road so they can get out their cars and scream for joy because their Kia makes them uncontrolably happy. Whatever. Or how about the guy driving his new, redesigned Camry down the highway and people are so taken with it's looks, everyone drives circles around him. Give me a break! I don't understand why the car companies waste their money on this silly nonsense. Why don't they tell us something useful about the car?

"ateixeira","March 2002"," I see all the 4Motion, 4Matic, and Quattor ads and can't help but think about how all Subarus have AWD. They can promote their AWD, but by default they have to talk about the set backs with their 2WD models.-juice "
"maxintosh","March 2002"," Why don't we ALL just drive Subarus? Then we can all have the exact same car!You're forgetting that Audi was the real pioneer of AWD systems with quattro. Today, quattro (4Motion is exactly the same) is still a more sophisticated system than Subaru's generic (and less expensive, for sure) AWD system. Yes, that's right. Whereas Subaru uses viscous diffies which require a fair amount of wheel spin before the oil in the clutch gets hot enough to thicken to the point where a decent contact point is made, Torsen differentials (used by VW and Audi) react quite a bit faster. However, they are more mechanically complicated which makes them costlier to own and maintain.Not that it actually makes a difference to the average driver, but then again, neither does AWD in general (depending where you live) except worsened gas mileage. In foul weather, skid control systems will help the average driver far more than any AWD system, because AWD is a drivetrain and thus only works when your foot is on the accelerator. In snow or very spirited driving however, AWD *can* be a Very Good Thing. Most people outside of the snow belt or boonies simply don't need it.Food for thought! "
"andys120","March 2002"," For the most part your post is right on the money but I'd point out that AWD is an advantageeven without snow (better cornering grip, more stability), on dry pavement or rain-wet pavement.There's a reason why awd has been banned from F1,Indy Cars, BTCC, Trans AM and most other forms of racing and it's practically mandatory in WRC. "
"andys120","March 2002"," The Superbowl ad, with the '59 Eldo convertible makes no sense to me.Isn't the CTS supposed to be the opposite of the bloated land barges that Caddy's been selling to the retirement crowd? If that's so why trot out the biggest gaudiest land barge of all. If they had to do a nostalgia ad they could have showed something sportier like say a '49 coupe.Interestingly the Porsche ad with the old RS Spyder and the new Boxster is very similar but works a lot better because ""A Porsche is what a Porsche's always been."" That's not entirely true but it's close enough. BTW the guy driving the old car in that ad looks to me just like former F1 driver Innes Ireland. Does anyone know if it is? "
"tj_610","March 2002"," I must admit (as I posted on this board a LOOONG time ago), I did like that first Kia commercial. And the wife's reaction just made it better -- classic boy/girl difference about love of the car. And for the same reason, ateixeira, I liked that VW ad with the window trick, too. Sorry.Haven't done this in a while, so I'll ask again. What is your favorite car ad ever? This is hard, I know, and your (and my) answer may change daily. I think my personal fav is the Nissan Z ad with the Barbie dolls and Van Halen music. "
"ateixeira","March 2002"," Subaru uses three distinct AWD systems, not just the VC. In fact, the VC is only used on a small minority of vehicles (and manual tranny only).And the VC works in frictionless ice, for example, while a Torsen doesn't. That's why Audi also needs traction control. A torsen is heavier and costlier, and better suited for the track, but on ice a VC is inherently better.Most Subies use a proactive AWD system that take several inputs and can shift power to either axle before slip occurs. Torsen and VC systems are both reactive.I'm all for skid control systems. AWD too. To keep this on topic, I believe the VW ads where the Taurus is sliding on ice (a torsen's achilles heel) tend to promote Subies more than the Quattro/4Motion.No need to apologize, tj, we're all entitled to our opinions. I liked that Z ad, too. It made no sense that Nissan didn't offer that car for sale any more, but the ad was very cool.The new Joe Isuzu ad with the mud pouring over him and his Rodeo is funny. They tease the XTerra and 4Runner ads. And I usually don't like Joe Isuzu ads much.-juice "
"wishnhigh1","March 2002"," juice...can you explain how VC works on ice but Torsen doesnt?also, how does the ""proactive"" system work? "
"ateixeira","March 2002"," A torsen fails in when one axle is on a frictionless surface. There has to be *some* resistance on one axle for power to shift to the other axle. Audi now uses traction control in conjunction with their torsen AWD to address this inherent flaw.The VC doesn't have this flaw. It's liquid filled, and if one axle turns faster than the other, the fluid shears, heats up and thickens quickly, locking the two axles together temporarily. It takes a little longer to act, but it does work on ice. I have a VC AWD and can feel the power pulsing from front to back, the cycle takes less than a second.The best comparison is to look at the Miata. Early models had a viscous LSD, new ones have a torsen LSD, both on the rear axle. The former is better on snow and ice. The latter is better on the track, on dry surfaces. So if you live in Colorado, pick a VC, if you live in SoCal and autocross on weekends, pick the torsen.Subie automatics are completely different. Those gather inputs like throttle position, incline, and steering angle to determine how to split torque. So for instance if you're going up a slippery boat ramp, the torque will be on the rear axle before you even start moving, proactively, because the AWD is smart and knows you are going uphill.Neither the VC nor the Torsen are ""intelligent"" and neither will know this. Both are reactive. They will shift power to the rear axle only after the front axle spins. The torsen will need the aid of traction control if the ramp is really slippery.Hence proactive vs. reactive.-juice "
"tj_610","March 2002"," That's funny, ateixeira. I saw the Rodeo ad two nights ago for 1st time and immediately thought of this discussion! Is that a sign of addiction, or a cry for help? Anyway, it reminded me of the initial success of the Joe Isuzu campaign. And, like the Mazda zoom zoom, like it or not, everyone recognized it, and the guy became a pop icon for a short while.

"rfruth","March 2002"," Chevy like a rock, when I hear that imagine something sitting there and it won't budge, almost as bad as reminding everyone of the Ford / Harvey Firestone connection .. but the Mitsubishi commercial zero down & zero payments for the first 12 months (isn't the idea to pay for it up front or as quickly as possible) takes the cake, the sad part is it really appeals to some people.

"ateixeira","March 2002"," It's kind of like their safety recall program. Zero recalls until 2004, and then suddenly we reveal there were dozens we'd been hiding all along! Surprise!-juice "
"orcinman","March 2002"," Atex: True, but Ford isn't charging 10k over the Taurus for the Mercury stable-mate Call me crazy, but I get tired of platform sharing with non-luxury cars. I want a luxury-specific platform underpinning my vehicle, not a tuned bread-and-butter sedan, like the Camry (ES300) or Altima (G35).kristie_h: It's not age. Most of my college buddies just roll their eyes at Nissan commercials.These days, youth are more cynical than ever (except the middle school set and below, it seems). We get so outright annoyed with manufacturers shoving their product in their face, yelling: ""hey ain't this cool! You want it, right? Right? Our marketing people say you like to goof off and dance in cars? Right? RIGHT? PLEASE GOD BUY OUR POS!"".Three manufacturers are most guilty of these most heinous of insults: Toyota, Ford, and Mitsubishi. "
"ateixeira","March 2002"," You are right about the Camry and ES300 sharing a platform, but the Altima and G35/Skyline do not. The Altima did get just the rear suspension from the JDM Skyline, but they are on different platforms. The Altima is FWD and has a 110"" wheelbase, while the G35 is RWD and has a 112"" wheelbase. The G actually shares a platform with the new Z car, but the Z has a shorter wheelbase.Some of the press photos showed the bottom side of a G35, and you can tell how purpose-built it is for RWD applications. Check it out, it's pretty cool. The G looks good, and is about the most active topic in the Town Hall. Lots of buzz about that vehicle.-juice "
"machiavelli","March 2002"," Not to nitpick, but the G35 is a RWD sedan based on the same platform as the Skyline and the new Z350, the Altima is a FWD sedan. They use the same engine, but it makes a little more power in the G35. They do look similar. "
"ateixeira","March 2002"," Yep, VQ series 3.5l V6 engine. 240hp in the Altima, 260hp in the G35. 280hp in the Z supposedly.-juice "
"andys120","March 2002"," LX-300 and it's ""Multi-stage airbag"". They should have explained the benefits thereof. This ad left me thinking ""hell if safety's important, you go for the big 3: Mercedes, Volvo or Saab.These are the only manufacturer's who have demonstrated a concern for safety before it became a good marketing posture.To be fair a lot of manufacturer's have made great improvements in safety lately but I think Lexus is just one among many, this ad doesn't convince me otherwise.

"speterson1","March 2002"," Was watching a lot of NCAA tournament basketball this weekend...For the first time I saw the Saturn Vue ""ant"" ad. So now they have the ant one, the bunny one, and the water lizard one. Their tagline is ""comfortable in any surroundings"", but it seems to me like another subliminal point is ""this car is tiny"", lol.Also saw the new Joe Izuzu ad for the Isuzu Axiom. I like the ad, it's very funny (especially his line about ""the longest, sexiest, warranty of any SUV""). I can't tell if the overall point of the ad is obvious sarcasm or not though, I mean, in my opinion, the Isuzu Axiom is so boxy looking, it's about as sexy as a refrigerator.My favorite ads of the weekend were not even really car ads, but two Midas ads. The first one with the Yugo owner who wants to jump the bridge cracks me up every time, and the other one with ""Mr. AC"" and his frozen arm mishap is also hilarious, love how he starts waving with his other arm after the first one falls off!Steve "
"loncray","March 2002"," Saw an interesting ad this weekend - Dodge truck passes a large boat on a trailer rolling sans tow down a mountain road the other way. Truck whips around, gets in front of the boat, and actually gets it hooked up while still speeding down the mountain road. Of course, I was wondering why I couldn't get a trailer to hook up that easily while sitting in a nice level parking lot, but I digress. Anyway, the truck pulls to a stop with the boat, preventing said boat from careening off a cliff. Then a Chevy with a camper goes by, and the lady in the passenger seat says ""Hey, they've got a boat just like ours!"" You then get to see the loose tow chains dangling from behind the Chevy. The ad bends reality, but seemed pretty cool! "
"ateixeira","March 2002"," The Yugo-over-the-bridge cracks me up. There was a movie that had a lot of Yugo humor, I forget the name now, but Bette Midler was in it. Anyone?That Joe Isuzu ad makes me chuckle.-juice "

"kenjabi","March 2002"," There's another ad that I've seen during the Tournament that I find interesting. It's the one with the two Volvos ""playing"" one-on-one on the roof of a skyscraper. It's pretty cool, the bodies of the cars move up and down to simulate breathing and a bead of sweat drips down one car. One thing I found interesting was when the two cars slightly bump head on, their grilles cave a little and then pop back to normal, like the doors of a Saturn would do. Is that a true feature, or just computer enhanced?GO TERPS! "

"rickabt","March 2002"," For the last several weeks, I've been noticing a change in the musical direction of ad agencies. There has been a recent inclination towards heavy 70's rock in commercials. In the underground, the popularity of 70's rock started to spike up about seven years ago, and now it seems poised for a big breakthrough.First I got a big kick out of Anheuser-Busch using Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Simple Man"" for their Busch commericals. Later, General Motors rolled out Grand Funk Railroad's ""We're an American Band"" for their all-inclusive ad for their many brands.One day, all of the stars and planets were aligned just so that both of those commercials appeared back-to-back on my TV during a basketball game. Had I not been watching the TV, I would've thought that I had just turned on the classic rock radio station or that the rednecks next door were having a big barbecue. "
"implicit","March 2002"," Where GM compares Malibu to the Nissan Altima and Toyota Camry. Just shows how pathetic they are and how better those car are. "
"ateixeira","March 2002"," Chevy is implying that its cars last a long time, long enough to be restored/customized. But I don't buy it - Chevy is near the bottom of CR reliability surveys.It's not enough to make a claim - you have to back it up with hard facts.-juice "
"tj_610","March 2002"," Wasn't that bouncing car trick popular, oh, about 15 years ago? Maybe I'm out of touch. What's next, breakdancers selling Camrys? Anyway, I'm sure installation of the bounce stuff would void that critical GM warranty...Anyone see the new G wagon Mercedes ad where it flies through the crash test wall? Pretty funny, although that is one overpriced, ugly truck. "
"svevar","March 2002"," Those commercials with Bill Ford are really starting to annoy me. I laugh every time I hear him say that Ford makes the best SUVs. And the pickup truck commercial is equally ridiculous. ""People come up to me and say they'd like to buy an old Ford truck, but they can't find one in good condition. That's a good thing."" I dunno... to me that just sounds like a funny thing to say in a commercial. What do you think? "
"andys120","March 2002"," I think young Bill's point is that trucks are made to be used and used hard. He's right about that! This business of using a truck as a substitute for a car started coz they used to be cheaper but now it's silly. Bash that truck, bang it around, abuse it! "
"ateixeira","March 2002"," You mean hydraulics. It's a small aftermarket niche, but it's been around for a while.I find at least one logic fault in every one of those Bill Ford ads. He mentions his grandpappy Harvey Firestone in one (after a severed relationship with them), and ""quality"" in most others. Ford is bottom of the barrel, last in quality among the former Big 3 now. They should not even mention quality.-juice "
"dpwestlake","March 2002"," ""Bash that truck, bang it around, abuse it!"" Then buy a new one from us next year. "
"rickabt","March 2002"," I've been pretty bugged about the recent batch of advertisements from GM touting the reliability of Chevrolet despite the obvious fact that they trail nearly every other brand in that category.The most suspect of all of these ads is the one that portrays a Hollywood filmcrew trying to capture a chase scene involving a new Impala following a getaway car. The getaway fails (not a Chevy), causing a halt in production. All of the ""actors"" look disappointed and sigh, as if to say ""Not again!""Then some smug jerk in the Chevy says ""We'd have this scene wrapped up by now if they had a better car!""Have you noticed what kind of car that getaway vehicle is? It's a 12-year-old Alfa Romeo! Yeah ... what car isn't more reliable than that?That just goes to show that Chevy knows that they're not really that reliable. "
"ateixeira","March 2002"," Not to mention - the car gets a flat tire. That has absolutely zilch to do with reliability.So Chevy doesn't even know what the word means.-juice "
"andys120","March 2002"," Me like! Some SLs are better than others but they're all in this commercial. Nice heritage theme. "
"target3","March 2002"," I love the Pontiac ones, you know, ""what would you do if you were given the keys"". What a joke! Let's see, I get keys to a car - I am going to go skydiving, bungy jumping, and whitewater rafting. Give me a break. Actually, give me the keys, I will take the car and sell it. "
"ateixeira","March 2002"," I like the SL ad too.-juice "
"rickabt","March 2002"," At one time, Pontaics sold like hotcakes. Then, they didn't sell quite as well. So Pontiac came out with cheap financing or rebates. Then that wasn't enough, so they had cheap financing AND rebates. Then that wasn't enough, so they came out with zero percent financing. Then that wasn't enough so they had to give the keys away to get people to drive the car. "
"a_l_hubcaps","March 2002"," Has anyone seen the Mercedes ad that shows the beat-up '70s Mercedes going into the crusher? It plays through a bunch of moments from the car's past, and then shows a new Mercedes coming off the assembly line. That was one of the coolest car ads I've ever seen, but it didn't quite have the desired effect on me...it makes me want to go rescue an old 300D from the junkyard :-)-Andrew L "
"tj_610","March 2002"," I do love the new SL ""heritage"" ad, but then again the SL is my dream car. Got no response before, so I'll mention it again -- I loved the MB G-wagon ad where it goes through the barrier and wall during crash testing. "
"ateixeira","March 2002"," LOL, Rick. Lutz agrees with you, and believe me he's doing something about it. Solistice looks like a good start.Saw the G class ad for the first time, finally, and thought it was pretty funny. They start so serious, you're waiting to hear about safety, and it turns humorous. Mercedes is classy with their ads. Leon Mandell passed away and they bought a full page ad honoring him, with only a tiny logo at the bottom. Very classy.-juice "
"stormdavy","March 2002"," The SL ad is a grabber, with the great ""Unchained Melody"" music from ""Ghost"" pulling you in if you're not in the room to begin with.There is a print ad in either Top Gear or Car: A cautiously smiling middle management type guy is in frontal view walking into his office. As he cracks open the door, a photo of his face, being used as a dartboard, is pasted on the wall to his right. In the foreground of the ad, the dart-thrower's raised arm and dart-holding hand is shown. Terrifically funny, but I can't recall what is being advertised. "
"ateixeira","March 2002"," What a cliffhanger! You really have me curious. Anyone know?-juice "
"seminole_kev","March 2002"," The ad you mention does appear in Car. Have it sitting infront of me right now. It's for Avensis Traffic Avoidance.Has the tagline of ""Be careful. You might get there too early."" What's funny is the confused look of the guy walking in. "
"stormdavy","March 2002"," Yes! THanks. That is quite the facial expression. You could say it 'stuck' in my mind. There is another ad on TV for I don't remember which car. Possibly Lancer. It is good, yet annoying: an uncomfortable looking blond gal is talking with her more successful friend (who owns the car being promoted) and then gets introduced to a guy wearing loud clothes standing by a Gremlin or Pacer. Good facial moves there as well. "
"seminole_kev","March 2002"," Standing by a Gremlin and I think it's an ad for KIA. "
"kenjabi","March 2002"," Along with the bridge jumping Yugo and the air conditioner man who's arm falls off, there's another Midas ad in the same light.This one, the Midas guy is talking about their warranty, and he explains it to an old lady (like in her 80's). The woman replies, ""That's great, but can you do anything for these?"" And she lifts up her shirt! They show the view from behind the woman and you see the two guys behind the counter. The looks on their faces is great!Then there's a Honda Civic ad with four young guys in the car. The fourth guy gets in and the other three are eating, reading, playing video games, etc. and he says, ""So, where are we going?"" The other 3 guys look at him like he's crazy, and then they all have a good laugh like he just said something totally stupid.I don't get it. "

"ab348","March 2002"," In Canada at least, Honda has run 2 of the more irritating ads lately. A few months ago there was the obnoxious twit in a Civic making fun of a guy filling up his SUV at a gas station; now, the same guy I think, making a fool of himself mocking the gas station guy changing the prices on the sign. If I was ever inclined to buy a Civic, these would make me stop. "
"tj_610","March 2002"," Haven't seen the gas station ads, but c'mon, does Honda really think anyone is comparison shopping the Civic and an SUV?I thought the 4 young guys in the Civic ad was dumb, too. But at least Honda targeted the right demographic for most new Civic drivers I see. (Although I drive an '88 Civic - that's different!) "
"ateixeira","April 2002"," I don't like the new Si commercial, where it sets off all the alarms in a parking garage, together sounding like hip-hop music. What, is the ride not smooth, so it sets off alarms?-juice "

"suvshopper4","April 2002"," After hearing about it here previously, I saw the Mercedes C-class ad for the first time last nite (during the NCAA Final).Good commercial, flashing back from the used-up car in the crusher and showing shots of its full life. I especially liked the shot from the interior, with the guy wiping off the window to peer inside the aging car as it was up for sale.Nice concept, showing the changing life of a durable car. And it was well done, with evocative images that held my attention and lingered afterward.Cars can have interesting 'lives' -but 'souls' (as the ad claims)?Oh, right, that's a different edmunds thread.

"38713","April 2002"," Ford has these commercials for individual models talking about how that particular car is better than the other cars in its class, or how it outsells its competition. For example, they talk about how the Explorer outsells its counterparts from Chevy, Dodge, and Toyota. I also saw one for the Mustang. They talk about how it outsells the Camaro and Firebird, and then say that the competition won't be around for long. They end their commercials saying, ""Home of 5 of the 10 best sellers."" Why would I buy a Ford just because other people buy them? Who buys a car simply based on sales numbers? It seems like Ford is trying to blow their own horn with cheap shots now that Chevy is outselling them. "
"svevar","April 2002"," It's funny I was just recently at the New York Auto Show and I was looking through Ford and GM brochures, and they were the only ones that emphasized their vehicles' supposed superiority to competitors. All of the other brands touted their own achievements without putting down the competition. This is the more tasteful method of advertising, in my opinion. "
"tj_610","April 2002"," Remember when it was taboo to mention your competition in ads? If my memory serves, this ""gentleman's agreement"" was first broken by Burger King about 20 years ago, aimed at you-know-who. I agree, it's much classier to rise above that. You never see BMW or Mercedes dogging each other in ads.Drove to Philly this weekend, saw a couple of billboards for the Mini Cooper of all things. One was great. It has a frontal pic of the car, and in big text, ""Let's sip, not guzzle."" Below that, it goes on about reasons to go small - reclaim your garage, be nimble, etc. "
"speterson1","April 2002"," I read in Newsweek another punchline they used on a billboard was something like, ""large vehicles may be attempts to compensate for shortcomings in other areas"". Pretty funny! "
"ghulet","April 2002"," I kinda like the new one, where they're in hell (with the Devil played by the guy who plays Clare's boyfriend on 'Six Feet Under').

No driver, just the truck moving stealthily. It comes on a waterhole, and there is a Ford 150. The 150 spins (no driver again) and then bolts off through the bush. Toyota chases. Cut to a scene where the Toyota is triumphantly dragging the 150 backwards back to camp. Very funny! "
"suvshopper4","April 2002"," I like the XTerra ad I saw the other nite: a kayaker is fighting his way thru the surf in the thick fog. He hits his keyfob and lights appear.

Looking forward to seeing it again. "
"tj_610","April 2002"," Yeah, something about another way to use your Xterra, then the line they have used since it came out, ""Everything you need, nothing you don't."" My new fave is the Joe Isuzu ad for the Axiom. Don't like the car, love the ad. When his floating head says ""America's longest, sexiest warranty"", I crack up every time.A while back, our good host mentioned her dread of the Mitsubishi ad (Eclipse?) with the obnoxious chick in the pink English driving cap Euro dancing in the front passenger seat. Gotta agree, makes me cringe. I think the other new Mitsu ad - maybe Lancer? - is a miscalculation. Is there ANYONE who isn't tired of that Barenaked Ladies song? "
"speterson1","April 2002"," I agree with everyone else about the Eclipse ad with the Euro dancing chick being stupid, yet every time it comes on I'm transfixed. I can't look away -- it's like watching someone have a seizure. "
"tj_610","April 2002"," You are right, speterson1! It's like rubbernecking at an accident scene. You just can't look away. Actually, I find that ad so painful, the feeling it gives me is more like the dread, embarrassment, and small amount of humor you feel when watching your best friend humiliate himself trying to flirt with an attractive woman. I feel that same sort of pity for Mitsubishi when that ad comes on. "

But the Seville is FWD, old-style Cadillac. The song should be reserved for the new Art & Science cars, and not the FWD (CTS, XLR, Escalade).The guy drives a Cadillac race car through the streets, and then looks back and it's - a FWD car with serious torque steer issues and part of the reason Cadillac hasn't rocked in a long time!Gimme a break.-juice "

"suvshopper4","April 2002"," Good catch.In the future, I'd like to see those commercials slightly different: The Kia owner and the Toyota owners 10 years after their purchases, comparing their cars.It is possible the Kia then will be playing the part now played by the Gremlin. "

Ram passenger comments what a beautiful day it is, and then has the driver take a left just before the edge of a cliff. The shot then changes to below the cliff, showing pebbles falling and insinuating the chasing trucks will soon be going over. I thought it was funny myself, though fans of the competing trucks might find offense! "

"storyteller","May 2002"," I fervently disagree with an earlier poster who liked that Kia ad where several women are talking about their cars and one of them really puts it to the (is it a Toyota?) owner about how much content her Kia has and how little it cost, compared to the Toyota. Then someone drops some gossip about whose boyfriend has been cheating. What a nasty little ad, full of people who are snide, competitive and utterly disagreeable. Makes me hate them AND Kia.That Australian wedding ad of Subaru's is funny. The best part is when the mud-sloshed bride shows up at the church, bravely wiping her face clean. Dundee (who doesn't know he dowsed her in mud on his trip to the church) notes, ""Rugged outdoorsy type. Good choice!""And I just got a chuckle out of that VW ad where the guy has his eye on a Jetta. When the salesman brings out a young couple to test drive that car the guy panics and then licks the door handle, marking it as his own. "
"seminole_kev","May 2002"," ads that push image and snobbery rather than the car itself. Especially annoying are the IS300 (which I like) ads where they're basically trying to say ""hey, you can land all the chicks you want with this car. It's all about the image."" ughh. Those kind of commercials turn me off from wanting to buy a car. "
"johnnylinc","May 2002"," I get a kick out of the new Passat W8 ad, where the dad, apparently in a hurry, is looking for his keys and ignoring his son who's sitting at the breakfast table. When the dad finds the keys and heads for the garage, we notice that the kid has disappeared from the table. Then we see the dad backing out of the garage & looking like he's about to blast down the street; instead, he's going about 5 miles an hour, furtively glancing to the right & then leaning forward toward the steering wheel. When the camera switches, we see the little kid on his bike, pedaling down the sidewalk as fast as he can. He's neck-and-neck with the Passat, and he has a huge grin on his face.I don't know if this ad will help sell Passats, but it's smart, clever, and funny at the same time; sure beats the heck outta those guys high-fiving each other over the free ride in the Pontiac... "
"alfox","May 2002"," but like most of the others, they shy from actually saying anything. They are all about name recognition and mood. At least VW's are entertaining. I agree with kev that the ads that push the personal image of the driver are somehow offensive. "
"loncray","May 2002"," I agree - the ad with the kid on the bike is funny and a little touching - but definitely selling an image more than the car itself. Not sure if this is a bad thing or not, at least the way VW does it. "

"storyteller","May 2002"," Or how about that VW ad for the Jetta that ran so much about four years ago, the one that seemed to be filmed in New Orleans' French Quarter. A Jetta with an attractive couple in it drives slowly through a scene of street life. Everything that happens outside the car (like the dude bouncing the basketball) is synched to the rhythm of the music playing under the ad. The general idea is that this car has some kind of magical synchronicity.What was especially appealing was the way this little commercial created a magical, self-contained world that was truly fun to be in for a few moments. And it worked well enough intellectually: with this car, the ad was saying, everything comes together in a wonderful way. "
"trlyka","May 2002"," I too like the VW commercial where the guy is at the grocery store and takes a flying leap to keep the carriage from hitting it. It's something I would do! I also like the VW commercial where the guy calls his friend to say they have the (silver) VW he wants and he sees the people walking towards it and he licks the handle. Lol. I do not however like the windshield wiper VW commercial where the music is playing and the people on the street appear to be doing things in sync to the wipers. It's corny. I think the Pontiac commercial where they compare their car to VW where they say ""No wonder they want drivers"" is pathetic. They compare their Pontiac Grand Crap with the VW GL which is the entry level. Come on Pontiac, get a life and a new design. "
"suvshopper4","May 2002"," I liked that VW French Quarter synch commercial too. The music was perfect, and I can still recall it years (?) later. Also, there were lots of nice little touches in the camera shots. I'll bet most people who saw that ad still remember it. "

I like it because it tries to direct your attention to the actual appearance of the cars, rather than what the cars can [supposedly] do.

He's sitting at his office in an office tower at a late night (reminds me of sitting in my place here and studying) and suddenly grabs his keys to spin around the city with his car. ""Addicting"" is a great ad theme for the new Nissan.Print ad in Forbes for the Tahoe: ""you're a small speck in the universe, so you might as well be a powerful truck-owning speck""... compared to themselves, GM thinks of everyone as a speck in the universe.Toyota's ads are the best GM-wannabe-poseur noises out there, but you can't really outdo GM in that.

What's bad is when you see two ads running for different products, and you can instantly tell they came from the same ad agency because they are SOOOOO similar. As for copy-cat ads, most of you won't remember them, but the ZOOM ZOOM ads are very similar to ads that Volvo ran years ago. They had boxy Volvos coming off of a car hauler's trailer, hitting the brakes and doing a 180 degree turn, then racing down a highway veering in and out of cones and other obstacles just mere inches from each other. I had forgotten those ads 'til I saw the 'Automobiles' show that featured Volvo on the History Channel recently.

"andre1969","June 2002"," The VW Jetta ad, where everything is moving in sync to the wipers and the music, makes me think of an old Plymouth ad I saw once. It was for the 1968 models, and had a catchy jingle. I think they called it the ""Plymouth beat goes on or something like that"", but they had wiper blades, turn signals, the fender-mounted turn signal indicators, lights flashing, people closing doors and trunks and hoods, EVERYTHING going in tune with the groovy music.I kinda like that Caddy CTS ad, although I'll admit it makes me want the '59 Eldorado more than the CTS too! I could almost see a spoof of this ad, where the '59 Caddy hunts down the CTS out in the desert, along the lines of Steven Spielberg's ""Duel"" (just replace the Valiant and the tanker truck) "

Of course, Wayne and Garth were laying on the hood of a stout '77 AMC Pacer.

"petra02","June 2002"," In my lifetime, the most agrivating commercials I've ever seen are Kia commercials. The thing that's annoying about them is that they're so haughty. They claim that, because Kia's have more features and a lower cost, they're better than Toyotas. They've even effecively ""bashed"" Toyota in one commercial, where the Toyota owner breaks the rear gate on her RAV4. Okay, no offense to Kia owners, but I don't think Kia is in a position to mock an automaker that sells about one hundred thousand cars more a month than they do. Their attitude is just... dumb. Now, those comercials were on about 8 months or so ago. Of course, there are now new ones. At least they're not bashing their competitors again, but their commercials are still, well, dumb. You know the ones: Where the old guy gets covered in sawdust? Kind of amusing, I guess, but I don't see what anyone would buy a Kia just because the commercial enertained them. "

The Pilot driver looks at the dogsledder as he passes, gives a look, drives off and signals back into the ""lane"" it was originally driving in. ""The new Pilot, from HONDA"" says the voiceover. (Haven't we seen this dogsledder/SUV thing in a Highlander commercial once?)All in all a collective dud. IMHO.2) A guy and his two sons come back from riding their ATVs in the desert. They hop into the Pilot all dirty and grungy, dirt on their teeth, hands, and all over the body. The father presses the NAV system button and leaves a dirty fingerprint.

They continue packing until the room is empty except for the crib; the back of the van is crammed full.One of the alleged adults says something like, ""Do we have everything?"", to which the other replies, ""Yeah; we'll only be gone for an hour."" Observations: The van is so packed with crap that the center mirror may as well not be there. If the driver has to panic-stop, a big pile of unsecured stuff will come flying toward the passengers, including Junior, with potentially disastrous results.They're only going to be gone for an hour, so 99% of what they took is completely useless anyway.In the other commercial, a frazzled couple is driving their Odyssey through a neighborhood late at night; a baby is sleeping in the back seat. They pull up in front of their house; one says something like, ""She's finally asleep"". The wife exits the van, and the husband reaches back to the little one, pinches her foot, and says her name. The baby awakens and immediately begins bawling. The wife hears this & looks frustrated as the husband smiles and begins to drive away.What sort of numbskull would treat his child so badly, and what sort of twisted logic is this, with the end result being that the dad gets to drive a few more miles IN HIS FREAKING MINIVAN???If Honda spent more than four dollars developing these ads, they paid too much.Tagline: Honda Odyssey--The van for total morons who have no business being parents in the first place.Sheesh! "
"maltb","August 2002"," Sorry to say I haven't seen those and I'm not a Honda owner, but those ads sound great! I guess it all depends on your your point of reference. Also, guess you could surmise that you are not in their target for that vehicle.  "
"alfox","August 2002"," Surely you're not looking at car ads to be accurate representations of the human experience. I haven't seen them, but I can tell you as a parent, they sound funny! Trust me, loading up to go out with kids it sometimes seemed like we were taking everything in their room.I think they're meant to be a tad metaphoric, not realistic. "

"verozahl","August 2002"," I think that Honda's advertising, when they do advertise, is crappy. Stick to the basics: show some racing cars, explain value. Don't try to be kitschy. "
"suvshopper4","August 2002"," Why show racing cars if you're trying to sell minivans?Those ads are geared toward the people who might actually buy and drive a minivan - young parents.Seems to me, Honda got it right. It ain't kitsch, it's cute. Maybe not to you, but it is to the people who have little kids (who tend to be cute themselves). "
"crkeehn","August 2002"," I found both ads to be a scream. Any parent of a young child/infant will certainly identify with the first ad. The second ad is similar in flavor to an Acura ad I just saw (probably same advertising company). The husband and wife are driving up a long winding road, the wife is reading a real estate listing as they are on the way to view the house. When they get there, the husband steps out, looks at the winding mountain road they obviously just drove up and announces ""We'll take it."" Both that and the second Ody ad celebrate the fun of driving. "
"rworrell","August 2002"," There is just a terrible Ford ad running right now. Voiceover provided by gravelly-voiced rockhead--unshaven, cap on his head, flannel shirt. He's sitting in his Ford truck at a boat launch waiting for the guy before him to pull his boat out. ""Normally, I figure a guy like that gets what he deserves""--cut to overweight doofus wailing as he chases his Chevy truck, which is rolling back into the lake. ""But I guess I was feeling generous this time.""So, rockhead tows BOTH the Chevy truck and the guy's boat out of the lake. As he unhitches the truck, the doofus' surprisingly hot wife says, ""Wow, that really sank fast.""Rockhead smirks, runs his hand along the box rail of his truck and says... ""Yeah--like a rock.""This commercial is so incredibly smug and idiotic and annoying I just cringe whenever it comes on. Fortunately, we have TiVo, so I rarely have to actually sit through it, but man does this thing bug me.I feel better having vented, though...  "
"speedshift","August 2002"," The latest Lincoln LS ad bugs me for several reasons.First, the theme is the same one you listen to when you call the L-M customer hotline and they put you on hold. And of course the only reason I call the hotline is because I'm ""completely satisfied"", not just ""mostly satisfied"", and I want to make a new friend.Second, anyone driving a Lincoln LS at the subsidized lease rate of $399/mo. plus tax (and that should be everyone) can afford a racing boat like they can afford a castle in Ireland.Third, anyone who can afford a racing boat aspires to better things than an LS.But hey, it's all pretend.

"ab348","August 2002"," I have to admit, after disliking the current Lincoln ads initially, they have grown on me. The 3 Navigator ads - one with the lovely blonde whose date drops his overcoat onto a puddle for her; the one with the guy making all the power assists keep time with the music, and the one with the woman with the groceries in the parking lot as it starts to rain - plus the one for the Town Car that makes it seem like the guy is getting fitted for a suit; all of them have a certain style to them. Plus I like that theme song. Well done.In contrast, here in Canada, Kia has started running their ""swamp tour"" ad for the miserable little Sportage again. Lord, no... "

And, no, I'll probably never be in the target demo...:)I guess the one where the 'rents load the whole roomful of stuff would've been mildly amusing had I seen it first, but I saw the other one first & it really put me off. I don't get the logic of portraying a guy who would deliberately drag his infant daughter out of the house and then deliberately rouse her from a sound slumber just so he could drive the Odyssey; I thought, ""That's no way to treat a baby; what a pinhead."" That set me up to find fault with the other one, too. Ah, well. Now, if the guy was hauling baby in an NSX or an S2000, it might've made a difference. ;-)To me, a great kids & cars ad is the one by VW where the dad in his Passat W8 races the son on his bike--that one makes me grin every time I see it.

"petra02","August 2002"," Ford marketing certantly isn't very creative. First, they take Queen's ""We Will Rock You"", depite the fact that ""Like A Rock"" is Chevrolet's ad. Having both these brands compared to a rock seems dumb to me, but fitting in the reliability sense. Now, of course, there's the F-350/icebreaker commercial. Can anyone besides me guess where Ford got the idea for this? To me, it seems reminicent of the GMC commercial that ran earlier this year; the one where the GMC hauls the rusty boat onto the beach, and the guy says ""It's a bit of a fixer-upper""? Not my idea of a brilliant ad in the first place, but I never thought Ford would be dumb enough to try the same pitch [towing a boat] just a few months later. Clap. Clap. Bravo, Ford.Another commercial I hate is the pretensious ""Who you callin' NEAR perfict?"" Camry ad. Save that for Lexus. "
"swschrad","August 2002"," Dodge has that one sewn up "
"i_luv_toyota","August 2002"," The new ad with ""Mambo #5"" used as the song. But Toyota goes one step further, they replace the girl's names used in the song with Toyota car model names.For example: ""A little bit of COROLLA in my life, a little bit of MATRIX by my side."" And the poor ""sunflower"" girl with the Corolla sounds like she has bronchitis!Even crappy songs aren't safe anymore. "
"svevar","August 2002"," Tonight, I saw a Saturn ad for their entire redesigned 2003 lineup and was really impressed. It showed people walking through streets and highways devoid of any cars. As they shuffle along, the people stop at stop signs, make right turns on red, etc. At the end of commercial, a shot of the 2003 L-series, VUE, and Ion is shown, with a voiceover that says something like ""We do things differently b/c we never forget we're building cars for people."" I thought the ad was unique and meaningful. It really had something to say about Saturn's values. On the other hand, I hate each and every vehicle Saturn has ever produced, but this ad was great. Has anyone else seen it? If so, do you agree? "
"svevar","August 2002"," Those ""Mambo #5"" ads (I've seen a few versions) are just further proof that Toyota ads are atrocious. I honestly cannot remember ever seeing a ""good"" Toyota commercial. Toyota's all time low: the ""I'm Too Sexy"" ad. Toyotas might be extremely durable and well-engineered, but sexy? Not a chance in hell...Just as annoying as the Mambo ads, Ford now bombards us (at least in the NYC metro area) with their end of model year clearance ads, complete with Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" blaring in the background. The song is so over used that it has become a sort of clich?, as have Ford's repeated brags of making five of the ten best selling vehicles in the U.S. Ford outsells other brands. Does that really mean anything? "

"petra02","August 2002"," Something that I would find uproariously funny would be if all SUV commercials all featured Pink Floyd's ""Another Brick In the Wall"". I can picture it: An Explorer drives through the ad, the announcer says, ""Be like everyone else: Get a Ford SUV!"" and, in the background, you can hear the children singing the chorus: ""All in all, you're just a- 'nother brick in the wall...""HA, HA, HAAAAAAH!!! It's funny 'cause it's true... "
"speterson1","August 2002"," Saw a new Outback ad last night where a couple drives slowly to a secluded spot through some rough terrain, you can tell they're looking for something. Then as they slowly approach a clearing, you see them smile and say something to the effect of ""they're beautiful"", as they show several deer feeding along a stream. Then the stillness is interrupted by a menacing growl getting louder, the deer perk up and take off, and finally a big black Explorer or Blazer skids to a halt beside the Outback. The dork driving opens his window and asks the Subie passengers, ""what are you looking at?"" Then the new AWD tagline, ""if you don't get it, you don't get it"".Clever ad, made me chuckle. "
"i_luv_toyota","August 2002"," It's not only NYC, we here in Connecticut are overwhelmed (and I don't mean impressed) with those Ford commercials, too. Also the major reason Ford sells the 5 (of top 10) cars in America is because a high percentage of Ford cars/trucks are sold to fleets (rentals, state vehicles, etc.). It doesn't mean anything, it's like saying McDonald's makes the best burgers because they sell the most.Another one that's being forced upon us is those god-awful Chevrolet ""Walking on the Sun"" ads. See those and that ugly Avalanche thing at least twice during each commercial break!Those Honda ads with the ""definitions"" are losers as well. Plus the music in them is annoying. "
"bored","August 2002"," Well, I saw a Ford commercial last night. It was about the Ford Ranger. You could lease a new 2002 Ranger for Blah-Blah-Blah. Had We Will Rock You playing in the background. The Bad? The vehicle shown was a stripped F-150. Nowhere near a Ranger. Now people who just pay attention to pictures will visit their Local 31 Metro Detroit Ford Dealers will be looking at the F-150, and not the Ranger, and have paper shock when the F&I department calls them up. Of course, if they have gone this far, they might buy it............since they believe it is a Ranger in the first Place. "

Channel 7 is a semi-Korean station, serving the Korean pop. of Kitchener]. Anyway, it amazes me that 31 Detroit dealers have managed to stay open, despite Ford's cost cutting. I figured they would have sold at least a couple of them to Hyundai, or something. The ""31 Metro Detroit Ford Dealers"" ad is forever embedded in my mind, and I doubt that's good thing, especially for a Canadian. It's not like I'm going to Detroit to buy a car [least of all, a Ford]. Suddenly, I find myself wondering if Eminem, in his pre-entertainment years, ever grafito-tagged a Metro Detroit Ford Dealer. With that jingle, I wouldn't be suprsied. Frankly, I'd be quite happy... "

"porknbeans","September 2002"," One was for the new Mercedes E-Class where the owner does everything in his car (ie live, eat, sleep, goes to the dentist, etc.). IMO, awful commercial, too much on the guy and only one shot of the car. The other was for the VW Passat with 2 guys stopping at a convenience store for munchies and a fill up. Each guy is sunburned on one side from riding with the windows open and the sun on their respective half. They end up leaving the station switching sides in the car after seeing each other. Again very little of the car, but a funny and cute commercial. "
"markvandersall","September 2002"," They have figured it out. Best car commercial to date is the one where the guy is trying to make it to the wedding on time. When he gets there, you are not sure whether he is there to break it up or if he's the groom and just late. It is the best yet. "
"petra02","September 2002"," I don't really like that commercial. I must admit, it is very well done; it seems less like a car commercial than a movie trailer at times. However, I just think there's not enough exposure to the car. The music and most of the scenes seem to point more towards the driver's perils. However, many of the other Jetta commercials are very good, and entertaining, too. Have you seen the one where the guy is standing next to the car, and the salesman is walking up with a different potential buyer? So the guy panics, and licks the door to mark the car as his. Hilarious. I also like the one where the guy can't wait to get his Jetta, so he's on the assembly line as it's being built.Also, Volkswagen's commercials really got the point across in the past. Think of the VW Beetle ads: A winter scene, with nothing else moving but a Beetle, and the caption, ""Ever wonder how the snowplow driver gets to the snowplow?"" And, of course, ""Think small"". Those are genius, unforgettable. I wasn't even alive at the time, but I think those slogans are some of the best I've heard in my lifetime. "

From what I remember from the ads, they show a bunch of still pictures of people and Nissan vehicles. At the end of the commercials they show the Nissan logo, the word Shift_ and then another word (eg, passion, power, desire, etc.). It changes the word slowly, but quickly accelerates the change until it's like 15 words/sec.In one commercial, I remember a picture of a cop, then a black screen with text that says ""Let's be careful out there"", or something like that. Then it shows a picture of the 350Z. "

On long trips my arm gets fried from having it out the window but that's about all.At any rate, I do understand it's exaggerated to get the point across. Still a good ad, would be a great ad for about any other maker but since it's VW my expectations are higher.  "

The IS300 had a series of commercials that were just awful - basically showing women falling all over this guy after he pulls up in his IS. ""The Lexus IS300. The car for self absorbed pricks who think they're God's gift to women."" Pretty revolting. The ads for the ES300 with the little European looking kid were stupid (hey, didn't he work for Mazda?) ""They say the car, it has powers magical. In this car, I would like to ride"". Wha? If they're going to make him speak ridiculous broken english at least give him a foreign accent.

"petra02","September 2002"," Are you talking about the ""One Week"" commercial, or the other one, ""get up, get up, get your body in motion...""? I usually refer to Mitsubishi commercials by their songs. In this way, they're pretty easy to identify. A lot of people seem to agree with me, too, because Mitsubishi walked away with a couple of awards for best car commercials. Those who think these songs suck may not agree, but, A: It's pretty obvious who they're aimed at, so if you're out of the age group, what are you missing? B: Like I said, everyone knows these songs and their corresponding commercials. In fact, @ a concert I saw on TV, B.N.L called ""One Week"" the ""Japanese Car Song"". Like it or not, the Mitsubishi messages are spreading.BTW, Nissan was one the other major breadwinner at the best car commercial awards, with 3-4 awards. I like the Nissan ones better than Mitsu's, too. Some of their commercials have had some really great songs, like ""Come Together"". At any rate, these were the awards for last year, so I'm waiting to see what ads take the cake for 2002. I fully expect Cadillac to walk away with an award for their commercials featuring Led Zepplin. "

"checkme","November 2002"," Toyota finally appears to be getting its act together with commercials- at long last, it's been like 20 years!!!!!I like the new TV ad which shows people describing how their Toyotas make them feel. I can't imagine Toyotas actually inspiring such passion in real life, but for an ad, it's darn good.There was a wonderful Toyota commercial on the radio the other day. It featured an African-American couple who went to vist their son. He wasn't home, so dad started looking at the son's car in the driveway. He thought that the son was becoming a spendthrift, because he had bought such an expensive luxury car. He went down the list of features (leather seats, sunroof, 6-CD changer) and after each one complained about the cost. What was his son, a rap star?His wife finally interrupted to inform him that his son's car was a Camry. After that, the dad's attitude changed completely- he was so proud of him, and just knew that his son had inherited his intelligence! "

"alfox","December 2002"," in the case of nuclear only one is correct. Either Jag pronounciation is phonetically accurate, depending only on dialect. Jimmy Carter's pronounciation of nuclear (and W's as well) as ""NU-cular"" are corruptions that are not accepted as correct in any dictionary as they displace the ""L"" from the 2nd to the 3rd syllable. It's one of my pet annoyances, along with supposably and irregardless.

"golic","December 2002"," Just like ""porsche"" unless you own one its ""porsch-A""In this case it is the Jag commercial, who can pronounce it any way they please. In this case they are pronouncing it just to make it seem more uppity (if thats a word) "
"alfox","December 2002"," That's true, and applies to all the words you listed and Jaguar as well. But dialect does not forgive pronounciations or usages that are outright wrong, like the ones I listed above.Being a Virginian living in Massachusetts I have great fun pointing people to the dictionary on pronounciation of ""aunt"", where both are correct but ANT is preferred. Most natives here think anything but ""awnt"" is an abberation.

Apperently some safety [non-permissible content removed] thought it would encourage fast driving. I wonder what they must think of the recent Maxima stuff.???I loved the later 300zx ad with Ken and Barbie(that's using imagination). Mad TV actually parodied it, with Ken driving off with G.I. Joe(So funny I almost had to change my pants).???A bad one: When the Subaru Outback came out some years back, the ad called it the ""world's first sport utility wagon"". Well by their definition, station wagon, four wheel drive, high ground clearance, wasn't the AMC Eagle actually the first?????The thing that irritates me most, though, is the disclaimers. I realize there are a lot of dumb people out there, but come on. The current Ford Exploder er... Explorer ad show the guy driving along a mountain, then onto a cloud.

But the more I see it the more I dislike the 2 people. The guy especially seems like a pretty slimy character (check the look on his face as he's driving near the end of the spot) but both of them reveal themselves to be fairly reprehensible by their behavior.

You're right, the ones you're talking about, I don't think are very effective, which might explain the new ad I described above, which goes back to their ""advertising roots"" a little bit. Since its inception though, Saturn's ads have done a good job of conveying the strengths of the vehicle.First, it was the ""Different kind of company, different kind of car"" ads, talking about the non-haggle dealership experience. Then they came up with the dent-resistant doors, and advertised that. Then they started making 3-door coupes, and advertised that feature.Also, you prove my point when you say ""They're strictly lifestyle ads - a lifestyle I don't need anymore."" That's because they're not advertising the car for YOU. Those who already drive Lincoln SUVs are NOT their target audience. Heck, I'm in my mid-20's and drive a used Honda, and I'm not even who they're targeting. They make simple cars for simple people. They're targeting kids who are looking to buy their first new car and don't have much money. And unlike Mitsubishi, they can actually deliver that. "

The driver checks his rear view mirror & begins to slowly pull away.... just then, another young guy jumps out from behind a tree, tucking himself in (had been peeing behind the tree), and starts running after the car as the theme music from ""Chariots of Fire"" starts playing..... flash back to the 3 inside the car who are laughing hysterically! Then you hear the announcer say ""Some things are just too good to pass up.""Not sure it would convince me to buy a Sentra, but the commercial is very entertaining. :-) "
"intrepidspirit","August 2003"," has a nice commercial out. Guy dressed in 50's overcoat and fedora gets on the subway. Outside his window he sees a a poster of a huge 50's Caddy. As the subway pulls out, you see the same poster over and over again and the Caddy appears to be driving. A CTS pulls up alongside, followed by other Caddies. The subway car stops and it's 2003. the guy gets off the subway and looks at a poster of a CTS. The voice-over says ""you could have seen it coming"" or something like that.A lot of imagination went into this commercial and it is pleasant to watch... "
"andre1969","August 2003"," or a couple at least, that anybody who lives in the Baltimore, MD area should recognize. Antwerpen Hyundai is having some kind of sales blitz going on where they're trying to sell 1,000 Hyundais in a month. They're pretty annoying, but my friends and I have found a way to have fun with them. Here's a rough script, of how they go...there's two guys, one who's a sales manager or some other peon, and then an old dude who I guess is Jack Antwerpen, who I guess owns the place.Anyway, it goes something like this...Peon: ""Who has the best value?""Jack: ""HYUN-DAI!!""Peon: ""Who has the longest warranty?""Jack: ""HYUN-DAI!!""Peon: ""who has the best selection of Hyundais?""Jack: ""WE DOO!!""Peon: ""How many Hyundais are we gonna sell this month?""Jack: ""ONE THOUSAND HYUNDAIS!!""Peon: ""And how are we gonna do that?""Jack: ""SAY YES TO EVERY DEAL!!!""It's grindingly stupid, but if you say Jack's lines along with him, using your best ""harelip"" voice (which Jack kinda talks in, himself) it's actually pretty funny.Politically incorrect, but funny ;-) "

And possibly some other numbers are missing as well. So if the announcer does the math, it doesn't sound as good. "

Which car company wouldn't want the car buying public to think their vehicles are just as good as Hondas and Toyotas? Kia and Hyundai are both guilty of subliminally stating that their vehicles are just as good as the best Japanese vehicles, only they're lower priced and come with better warranties. The fact is they aren't as good as the best Japanese vehicles, and they'd better come with a much longer warranty because you're probably going to need it! "

"svevar","March 2004"," Last night I saw one of the three commercials from Chrysler's new ""Inspiration Comes Standard"" campaign. It focused on the redesigned 2005 Town & Country and its ""Stow 'n' Go"" seats. Very nicely done, in my opinion&#151;a vast improvement over the lame ""Drive & Love."" What's more, no sight/sound of Celine! I look forward to seeing the other two commercials, one of which is for the Pacifica, the other for the full Chrysler lineup. A handful of Chrysler 300 commercials&#151;one dedicated exclusively to the 300C&#151;to debut later in March.?-- Mark "
"bottgers","March 2004"," Maybe, but the difference now is the Korean vehicles actually aren't as good as the Japanese vehicles. Back then, the Japanese vehicles were better than America's, we just didn't know they were. "
"merc1","April 2004"," Not sure if anyone has mentioned it already, but there is a really good Jaguar commercial out now. It is the one in which the XJR is being led through San Franciso (I think) by something on a stick. The part in which it leaves the ground and lands every so softly on that air suspension is awesome. The car lands like a lightweight and seemlingly unflustered. Looks good too. Nice work. M "

"i_luv_toyota","April 2004"," ""Personally, I think the whole idea of any of the Korean car companies comparing their vehicles to Hondas and Toyotas is completely ridiculous.""I agree 100%. I don't see how a large warranty can be the sole reason to make me buy a cheaper, less than satisfactorily built vehicle like a Korean car. Toyotas and Hondas are better built and have an established reputation of reliability and thus do not need a warranty as large as the Koreans. The sales charts show that people are still willing to outlay more money for a better built car like a Toyota or Honda.Hyundai also has an ad out now showing Hyundai salespeople saying Hyundais are better just because they are cheaper than ""comparably equipped"" Toyotas and Hondas. Sounds like desperate measures to me, attacking your competitors verbally.And Kia really needs to give up those ""dare to compare (didn't Mercury use that term a while back, too?)"" ads. Being shot in the eyes with paintballs is not funny. What if the guy was adjusting his goggles and got his eyes shot out?! Lost an eye over a minivan argument?! Bad Kia!I haven't seen Toyota or Honda attack them or even each other in ads. That's probably why both of those companies get the respect (and the sales) they've gotten. "
"ghulet","April 2004"," Has anyone seen/heard this TV commercial? It advertises that the buyer will receive a free Dell computer with the purchase of any Ford Focus (and 0% or $2000 cash back, to boot). Fine, great, but the commercial uses the tune of 'The Farmer in the Dell' (apt, I know) to an annoying punk rock rift with super irritating fake 'rock guy' vocals. Naturally, I hear it like ten times a day regardless of how much TV I watch. "
"loncray","April 2004"," If you go to Snopes.com, they've got an article on an Internet ad for the (British) Ford SportsKa. I'd previously seen the one in which a pigeon about to land on the SportsKa is killed by the car's hood opening. Now there's one in which a (computer-generated) cat is decapitated by the SportsKa's sunroof. It's about the sickest commercial I've ever seen in my life. Ford says it was never approved, but it's very much in the same vein as the approved pigeon ad. "

"scscars","April 2004"," Ghulet: I've seen that ""Focus and a Dell"" commercial too, and I've gotten to the point that I hit the mute button on my remote as fast as I can when I hear that off-key opening note. That ""rock guy"" has to be the worst vocalist to have hit the airwaves in years.Saw a better commercial earlier today for Kia Spectra. A beat-up, rusted out 1980 Chevy Citation is sitting outside of an old warehouse type building in a downtown area. A man comes out of the building, pulls off a car cover designed to look like the Citation that uncovers a new Kia Spectra. The digital animation that morphs the Citation into a car cover is effective and actually got me to laugh--at a Kia no less. "
"kenjabi","April 2004"," In the same mold as the Focus/Dell ad (which I thankfully haven't seen yet), I saw a Ford ad that said if you buy an Escape in April, they throw in a trip to the Virgin Islands (!?). Has anyone else seen this one? I wonder if these giveaways by Ford will work or not. "

"i_luv_toyota","June 2004"," This time it's a braking test between the Galant and the Honda Accord. It's on an unfinished bridge with a bright yellow line painted on it showing where to nail the brakes. After they hit the brakes, it shows the cars progress stopped at the end of the bridge, followed by the SeeWhatHappens.com web address, and then cuts to the scene below the bridge, showing the Galant of course stopped before the bridge's end, and shows the Accord flying over the edge, to the tune of a punk-sounding ""Yeah, yeah yeahyeahyeah.""Why bother showing us the web address? We already know what happens. The Accord goes flying off of the edge of a bridge in a Mitsubishi biased braking test. At least the one with the Camry ended when the SeeWhatHappens.com website address is posted on the TV.What's next, a competition between the Endeavor and the Honda Pilot or Toyota Highlander to see who could get the front row parking space at the mall/grocery store first?

"svevar","June 2004"," For a few weeks, the Galant vs. Accord commercial ended without showing the Accord flying off the bridge. The clip of the losing Accord was added after the fact.

"norrmanndo","June 2004"," What&#146;s with all of the Hummer commercials and SUV commercials showing a soccer mom driving over a 2X4 or super model driving over a flat desert wasteland? A corvette could do that. The Subaru commercials make sense for what they are trying to do-- kick-[non-permissible content removed] on back roads. The Land Rover commercials actually show off-roading. The Murano commercials are about style which is correct, and they&#146;ll also get you thru that occasional snow storm. Highlander commercials make sense for a soccer mom in an area with significant snow or steep hills. Sports car commercials also demonstrate the intended purpose &#150; great handling. Well I guess the Hummer commercials are accurate after all, since most Hummer buyers just drive around town trying to look impressive and haul big egos. "

I have to believe DC is in a terrible predicament right now. I'm sure they'd love to dump their entire stake in this company. Chrysler is trying, and apparently succeeding, to turn themselves around and Benz is desperately trying to keep the ship of public perception upright as they slip in the quality rankings. The last thing they need is to be dragged down by this. The problem, however, is Chrysler has too many cooperative projects with Mitsu, from what I understand. I guess a new small car engine (4 cyl for Neons, Sebrings (or their replacements) is the biggest. I'm sure there are others. Would it be better to dump the relationship and try to plow money into their own development or just hope they can get it together here in the US? "
"speterson1","June 2004"," The Hummer ads have cool music (I dig that recent one with the techno music) and clever ideas but Hummers as vehicles for the general public are ridiculous. I live near Peoria in a small town of about 12,000 people, and there are a few people in town who have Hummers. I don't think I've ever even seen one dirty!

"gambit293","June 2004"," I like that new Land Rover commercial with the two college bums hiking down the road.They're talking about leading spiritual, zen lives when a Land Rover pulls over to give them a ride.

"badgerfan","June 2004"," My guess is that if Mitsubishi goes under, DaimlerChrysler will maybe salvage the ongoing projects, and personnel, tooling etc. involved with those projects out of Mitsubishi and maybe obtain the Normal, Illinois plant as well if it fits their plans. Likely it will be a mess however it plays out, but I doubt if Mitsubishi is really critical to DaimlerChrysler's overall future. Mitsubishi is just not a big enough piece of the whole pie, and it is shrinking daily. "

"carguy58","June 2004"," Has anybody seen this commercial? Its like a videogame type of commercial with the S40 in red being like a Ferrari. I was like Volvo is trying to be young and hip? Its like Volvo is trying to hard to get younger buyers. I just blew it off.I saw an ad for the S40 last week in the USA Today and the car caught my eye actually. Imagine that a 24 year old actually the least bit curious about a Volvo? I was though. I went to the Volvo website and the car looks like a solid product. I like the exterior design(mostly) and the interior is decent. Just the front of it I question if I like it. I especially like the optional sport package on the S40(dual exhaust and a little rear spoiler to top it all off.) I love dual exhaust tips on my cars.Volvo is a solid company(good cars.) Volvo's always struck me as a solid product with nothing really bad to say about them except for the boxy styling of the 80's and 90's.

"i_luv_toyota","July 2004"," Here in the New York area on the YES network, I am subjected to this awful commercial for the Infiniti G35 with ""intelligent"" all wheel drive. It shows the car driving around in different situations. The one I don't get is when it's driving around in the snow and there are people loading stuff in or out the back of a truck. A forklift backs into the path of this G35, which is flying down the street, and causes it to swerve out of the way (showing off it's AWD abilities).The part that irks me the most is the fact that in that last part, the car's headlights are off! If they were on like they were supposed to be, then the forklift wouldn't have backed into the road causing the G35 to swerve.I guess it's called ""Intelligent AWD"" because it has to cover the ""stupid"" driver who's driving around in inclement weather without his lights on!BTW cmartin411--Those ads are for the Tacoma, not the Tundra.

"andre1969","July 2004"," but I kinda like the one they're currently running that has the people driving around in their cars throwing frisbees.

"tornado25","July 2004"," ""chrysler closed belvidiere, IL about 25-30 years ago, home of plymouth, because of costs and overproduction.""Well, unless there were 2 plants or something in Belvidiere, that's not entirely true. My 1998 Neon was built at the Belvidiere plant. It may be closed now, since they make no Plymouths, of course.As for the Normal plant, I suspect they might take over the facility and if it's more modern and better equipped, maybe shut down an older, legacy plant. Otherwise, they'll probably auction it off to get some of their investment in Mitsu back.Love the current Mitsu ads, though. The best protection in the world or whatever. 3yr/15k maintainence, 5yr B-2-B, 7yr powertrain, etc. Yeah, not exactly the best protection because you're so gracious. More like, ""well, we have absolutely no reputation now, so we'll fool people with this plan and hope we're out of business in 5 years"". Yecch. Bad part is, I sort of like Mitsu's and would seriously consider a Galant. Worse, I don't think reliability is too much of a concern.

"scscars","July 2004"," Tornado25 and SWSchrad:I've got to say that the DaimlerChrysler Belvidere Assembly plant is alive and well, and is cranking out Dodge Neons and Chrysler Neons (Canadian and European markets) daily. This plant seems like its been around forever. My 1977 Plymouth Volare that I had for 6 years was built there. After that, Belvidere built Dodge Omnis and Plymouth Horizons, Dodge Dynastys and Chrysler New Yorkers, and after 1994, Neons. The plant literally sits on top of Interstate 90 a few miles east of Rockford, Illinois, and the plant displays whatever its building at the time on pedestals facing the highway. Since I pass this plant at least weekly, and the parking lot is full and the smokestacks are putting out exhaust, it looks like the plant's open, although they have a huge supply of Neons in their inventory lot.In the late 1980s, Chrysler was considering shutting the plant down and moving production to Mexico. With some cajoling from Lee Iacocca, the State of Illinois bailed it out with a series of economic development grants for plant expansion that doubled the size of the plant, and doled out millions in job training funds. From what I've read, Belvidere will be building the next generation of small Dodge and Chrysler cars which might not be called Neon, on a Mitsubishi Lancer platform starting next year. Unless plans have changed, there were no plans to build the Neon replacement on a Hyundai platform. As for the plant in Normal, Mitsubishi will be cutting jobs there in September, but no word as of yet that the plant is for sale. "

"jaserb","July 2004"," I think it's a stroke of genius. Let's see, we just came out with a great new truck engine, but it's a pushrod engine. Ford, Nissan, and Toyota are all getting props for their OHC motors while GM has a word association problem: ""GM"" = ""antiquated old-tech pushrod engines"".So, how do we keep the press for bagging on our great new engine just because it has pushrods instead of overhead cams? We call it a Hemi.Sweeeeet!-JasonOh, and by the way I am NOT anti-pushrod engines, especially in a truck application. But the auto press, especially the dumb ones, assume ""pushrod"" = ""bad"" and ""OHC"" = ""good"". "
"badgerfan","July 2004"," I don't know if it is a nationwide ad campaign or just local/regional, but almost every morning driving to work I come across radio ads for Lexus new or preowned cars that use an announcer with a forced ""uppercrust"" accent that drives me nuts. Good thing my (Taurus not Lexus) radio pushbuttons are easy to use, as I switch stations every time one of these comes on. These ads plus the tasteless Christmas ads with the bows on the Lexus gifts completely turn me off. I wouldn't buy a Lexus even if I wanted to spend the money on a luxury car, as I wouldn't want to be associated with the crass materialism these ads convey. "

"anythngbutgm","July 2004"," Make every mile count.Because there won't be that many of them? "
"andre1969","July 2004"," yeah you're right, the current Hemi is the third line of Mopar engines to be referred to as such.The original Mopar Hemi debuted in 1951, a 331 unit standard in Chrysler NYers and Imperials, with 180 hp, IIRC. I've read that the original reason they came up with the Hemi is that it put out the best power given the crappy octane of fuel available at the time. In 1952 they came out with a smaller Hemi for DeSoto, a 276.1 unit with 160 hp. That was the same HP that Olds got out of their V-8, but they needed 303 cubes to do it! In '53, Dodge came out with an even smaller Hemi, called the Red Ram. I think it was a 241 CID unit with 145 hp?These original Hemi's were often referred to as ""Whale"" Hemis, probably to differentiate them from the later 426, which was called the ""Elephant"" Hemi. I'm guessing the ""Whale"" term didn't come out till the 60's, though. Anyway, those early Hemis were dropped after 1957 in Dodge/DeSoto, and '58 was the last year for the Chrysler/Imperial 392 Hemi. They were all replaced with lighter, cheaper-to-build Wedge head V-8's like the 350, 361, 383 (there were actually TWO 383's the first few years) and 413. These engines ultimately grew to become the 400 and 440 in later years. They had nothing in common with the old Chrysler/Dodge/DeSoto engines.One of the displacements of that big-block was the 426, which, I think the first year it was out was just a wedge head with cross-ram induction, but then they got the bright idea to build a Hemi head for it. That gave us the 426 Hemi.However, while the early Chrysler/Dodge/DeSoto hemis were basically passenger car motors designed for long life, but with hopped up versions for some of the pre-historic musclecars, and for racing, the 426 was just the opposite. A racecar engine that was dumbed down a bit for street use. The ""Street"" Hemi was rated, conservatively, I've heard, at 425 hp. The race versions, I think were rated at 500 and up.Anyway, the 70's and tightening emissions regs, and skyrocketing insurance rates killed that one. Although you can still get them through Mopar Performance. I think a 426 Hemi is about $10K.The current Hemi, while people think it's a huge monster today, is about the size of a Mopar 318/360, but with slightly wider heads and a deep skirt design. It even has the same bore spacing as a 318/360. I think it also has the same stroke as a 360, but I'm not sure. The heads are wider than a typical smallblock pushrod, but much narrower than the ""real"" Hemi's of days gone by, because the rocker shafts are closer together. "

"scscars","August 2004"," The Corolla commercial spoofing ""Pimp My Ride"" is a riot! All its missing is someone imitating Xzibit. What's even better is that the commercial is a takeoff on an actual episode where a college kid wants to have his beat-up '86 Ford Escort pimped. When the custom shop goes to revamp it, they find that the car consists of the rear half of one Escort welded to the front half of a different Escort. Under California law, the car is illegal, so MTV bought the kid a new Scion Xb and the custom shop pimped it out instead. They fixed his ""bucket"" indeed! "

"i_luv_toyota","September 2004"," ""One contest was an elephant vs. a bunch of ""little people"" pulling a jet airliner."" Was it Fox, by any chance? Knowing their track record for shows, that's the first network I would suspect.Speaking of pulling, Fox has this show called the ""Next Great Champion"" or something similar, and a preview showed the contestants pulling F150s with straps attached to them.I guess if a human can pull an F150 by his own stregth, no matter how slowly, then you're theory is right.

"andre1969","October 2004"," but they did something minor to the front-end of it for '05 that IMO improves its look considerably.

A few years back, a young couple moved into a condo in my building. At the time they had a Ranger and a Mistubishi Mirage, both of them a bit rough, but not beaters...at least not yet.Well, almost immediately after they bought the condo, they must've gotten all sorts of credit card offers in the mail, or thought they hit the big time, or something, because he bought a fairly new Silverado, and she bought an '02 Camry.

In someone's swimming pool, on the front porch, etc. The gist of the commercial is that this is some Nascar driver's home town, and he's blowing the doors off of everyone elses cars (notably an F150 quad cab) in the neighborhood.I'm sure there was some sort of a disclaimer stating ""It's really not a very good idea to go screaming through a residential area at triple digit speeds in your ungodly fast pick-em-up truck"", or something like that.

The other LaCrosse commercial I've seen shows two cars racing around on a highway, combined with footage of a kid and dad playing with two slot cars racing around an AFX-type track.

"
"lemko","December 2004"," The LaCrosse is a really nice car. It looks much nicer in person than it does in pictures.Speaking of annoying commercials. The Lexus ""December to Remember"" commercials are back again this year. I think these commercials are in very bad taste considering how many people are out of work or struggling at low-paying jobs. This is the toughest time of year for these unfortunate folks and they have to see a bunch of materialistic yuppies getting expensive cars for Xmas gifts on television. This is the stuff revolutions are made of! "
"anythngbutgm","December 2004"," I just think it is too difficult a sell to convince buyers that the Lacrosse has even an ounce of sporting flair too it. Sorry, Buick does not possess the youthful image they so proudly portray in their commercial, no way. The ideal commercial would be parking this car infront of a Piggly Wiggly and touting how many bags of groceries you can fit in the trunk. At least that would be convincing. "

"andre1969","December 2004"," on Buick yet, though. It's going to take them awhile to shake their old fogey image, but it can be done. And it has been done in the past. For example, once upon a time, Pontiac was considered an old man's car.

The November issue of Motor Trend seems to indicate that the LaCrosse's ride and handling compare favorably with that of the Lexus ES330, offering ""Buick ride with more Euro control."" The Lexus ES330 is far from sporty (despite its equally farcical commercials depicting high performance), but it is the vehicle Bob Lutz has called GM's benchmark in designing the LaCrosse. And on that front, Buick has succeeded in building a viable ES330 alternative for thousands less (the 3.6L-equipped CXS starts at $28,995). My point is, marketers stretch the sporting capabilities of just about any family sedan, so I don't find Buick's ads particularly offensive, especially given that the LaCrosse does outperform some competitors like the Camry, Avalon, Kia Amanti, Grand Marquis, and Crown Victoria you mentioned. I don't think Buick has targeted the TL, G35, or Maxima, but rather the ES330, now-defunct I35, Avalon, and high-end Camry.""Buicks are barges, cushy cruisers, not sport sedans. They have a bore set of buyers, they would be smart to stick to that. Trying to cater to a younger crowd and alienating the core buyer is why Oldsmobile no longer exists.""That has traditionally been Buick's role in the marketplace, but with their average buyer's age at 69 years (!), GM will have to do something to attract younger buyers before the current customer base dies off. This requires that Buick inject some life into its vehicles. By following the Lexus model&#151;that is, retaining comfort and quiet, but avoiding the land-barge stigma&#151;Buick will attract new blood to the brand, while simultaneously keeping the current core buyer satisfied.From your username, I can tell you're no fan of GM.

"andre1969","April 2005"," the ""Fake Mini"" commercials yet? I first noticed a flyer that came in the mail, warning that the market was getting flooded with a glut of impostor Mini Coopers. At first it looked all official and such, but then I opened it up and they showed all sorts of hysterical stuff like a 1974 or so Dart with ""Mini Cooper S"" lettering pasted on the back. The copy underneath read something like ""At first glance, this is a very close replica of a Mini Cooper S. But the astute observer will note that the Mini Cooper S has two exhaust pipes, not one. And they are at the center of the car. Not off to the side. Or dragging on the ground.""They also had an old Lincoln Mark IV with a big Mini Cooper badge on the front, and the copy read ""sometimes an oversized logo can make a large car appear to be smaller. This particular example almost slipped past un-noticed, until an observer happened to take a tape measure to it""The other night I saw a commercial, and it was pretty funny. They tried to back some big 60's battlecruiser into a parallel spot that, in all seriousness, a real MINI would probably have a problem with, and it took out one of the parked cars! Then they showed a MINI zipping through a slalom course of road cones. Then along comes the Mark IV, and it just plows them all down.Pretty cute overall, even if it is poking fun at the types of cars that I love! :shades: "

The reason it annoys me is for one, why would a kid care about what lights up on the dashboard, and two, a CEL means nothing but a loose gas cap like 99% of the time anyway.

"i_luv_toyota","October 2005"," While watching football this past Sunday, I saw perhaps the most ridiculous commercial in recent memory. It starts off with a family of bears coming back from vacation to their ""trendy"" house to find it all disheveled much in the same way the children's story we all know goes. Then they all rush outside to the 3-car garage to see if their cars are still in place. ""Papa Bear"" opens the garage door to see his H1 still there and breathes a sigh of relief. ""Mama Bear"" opens to find her H2 still in place, and breathes a sigh of relief as well. But when ""Baby Bear"" opens up and sees his new H3 missing, he hangs his head in shame and sadness, and pushes away any help to cheer him up.Then we see a blonde woman driving along in what must be ""Baby Bear's"" H3, with the tagline: ""The H3--It's Just Right.""At first I thought it was the bears from the Charmin toilet paper ads come to life, but I guess it wasn't. This ad, like toilet paper, deserves to be flushed down the toilet. "
"ateixeira","October 2005"," All the ads seem quite weird, like the one with Godzilla.It's selling briskly, though.-juice "
"i_luv_toyota","October 2005"," Hummer ads are quite odd, but that's probably what gets them noticed.Seems to be a gimmick that works, though. I'm seeing them (H3s) more and more around my neck of the woods, too. "
"speterson1","October 2005"," I think Hummers are ridiculous for urban transportation, but I gotta admit a few of those ads have had really cool music...I especially liked the one where they just had a picture of a black Hummer transforming & splitting into lots of different kaleidoscope-like patterns of itself. "
"ateixeira","October 2005"," It figures the ads are all about show, for a car that's all about image.What else could they focus on? Least power in its class? No 6 available? Slowest? Least efficient? -juice "
"john_324","October 2005"," I love how all (or all I've seen anyway) Hummer ads feature the vehicle doing anything BUT going off-road.I just wonder what goes through the minds of their purchasers...can they really be thinking this SUV makes them appear as powerful and tough outdoorsmen? Almost from the beginning, these vehicles were the subject of late-night television jokes... :confuse: "
"ateixeira","October 2005"," And the H3 only comes with the in-line 5, so it hardly has the strength implied in the ads.GM is working on a V8 and a diesel for that vehicle, however. Then they can use images of Godzilla. -juice "
"loncray","October 2005"," ""Buy an H3 and a pretty blonde woman will come to your house and steal it!"" is not the message I'd want to send to potential purchasers. Now, if the bears had come home and Goldilocks had returned with the truck and was in the 'just right' bed waiting..... :P "
"anythngbutgm","November 2005"," :confuse: Why is there an ad for the Chevy Employee discount pricing at the top of the Edmunds boards? It even says ""must take delivery before 9/6/05"" :confuse: I know Chevy dealerships are pretty outdated, but I didn't realize you could literally step back in time by entering one... "
"anythngbutgm","November 2005"," Saw an ad (every commercial break) for Pontiac G6. They state blah blah blah... on the AWARD WINNING G6 sedan. Huh? I have yet to read or see a comparo where the G6 came out on top, much less being an award winner. What did it get the ""Good Houskeeping"" seal of approval or something? "
"john_324","November 2005"," It was probably from some sort of ""Powerful Pontiacs"" -type magazine...""the G6 is the best sedan EVER. Only minuses: Not enough body panel ribbing and ""Pontiac"" on trunk doesn't light up.""  "
"ateixeira","November 2005"," I posted this in a Honda thread, but I'll share it here as well.Honda uses the song ""Galang"" by artist M.I.A. in their new Civic coupe ads, the one with the car bouncing off the top of buildings.The funny part is the lyrics of the song mention BMW more than a few times. -juice "
"mjday1972","November 2005"," This commercial has a man, dressed in a conservative business suit, kiss his wife goodbye before going to work, walks out the front door, parachutes off a cliff - at the bottom is his Grand Vitara waiting for him. He then drives off-road to work. Dumbest thing I've ever seen. "
"anythngbutgm","November 2005"," would love to see an extension of that commercial to how the guy actually got home that day... Rocket pack maybe? "
"ateixeira","November 2005"," What goes down must come up?Yeah that is silly.I guess the idea is that owners are outdoorsy. They should focus on the capabilities of the car, not the owner.-juice "
"anythngbutgm","November 2005"," I believe it was Motortrend who comented on the new GV ""Well they still make great motorcycles""... Ouch.I like the new zuki, much more polished than the outgoing model. Makes a decent alternative to the CRV and RAV4 although I've never driven one. But isn't it based on the Chevy Cheapuinox? "
"ateixeira","November 2005"," I don't think so. It's supposed to be a hybrid full length frame/unibody, and the Equinox is not.It's more like the Grand Cherokee in its design. They even offer a low range.That's why I thought they should focus on what the vehicle can do, not its owners.-juice "
"fintail","November 2005"," I don't know if this is a regional commercial or not, but the Ford truck commercials aired in WA are horrible. "
"explorerx4","November 2005"," are they the ones where the motorcycle gang is afraid to go into the restaurant or the rattlesnake dies after it bites the guy? those are pretty bad. "
"fintail","November 2005"," These ones are all about bad music and bad acting. It's hard to describe...there's one awful music one at a concert, and something about a Ford truck in the parking lot with its lights on, and everyone clears out save for these 2 dorks. Just lame...but that might be some target market, the big jacked up truck crowd "
"lemko","November 2005"," ...it shows a bunch of people asleep behing the wheel of their Camcords while a Mazda 6 ""zoom-zooms"" through the sea of non-moving non-descript cars like a slalom. "
"larsb","November 2005"," Anyone else seen the new Jaguar ""Gorgeous"" commerical, debuted I think Thursday nite 11-10-2005 in the USA?It is completely mesmerizing, and beautiful, and suspenseful, and ABSOLUTELY made me want to go out and buy a Jag !! Too bad they don't have a hybrid or I probably would be shopping today.Wait til you see it - it's completely AWESOME !! Beautiful people, beautiful cars, great cinematography, a hypnotic narrator. It's really something special - probably the most moving and effective car commercial I have EVER seen.There's a brilliant advertising executive somewhere that's gonna make a lot of money from this commercial. Here's a link to a press release that talks more about how important Jag thinks this campaign will be for them:http://www.theautochannel.com/news/.../11/145241.htmlHere's a story that gives more details about the TV commercial itself:http://www.autoweek.com/news.cms?newsId=103343 "
"ateixeira","November 2005"," I like the ads, but the new look leaves me cold. They slapped a Ford Taurus grille on the same old shape.I swear, it's as if Jaguar knows it has to be one slot beneath Aston Martin. Perhaps their new tag line should be ""almost as beautiful as Aston Martin"".-juice "
"i_luv_toyota","November 2005"," Now that the new Nissan Xterra has won the MT SUV of the Year award, Nissan seems to be taking the opportunity to tell everyone at least once per commercial break.If I see that dog (what looks like a German Shepherd) holding that Photo-chopped award in it's mouth one more time... "
"smoot","November 2005"," Yup, agree with the car looking like a new Saturn at first glance! I don't mind the ad actually but I really do like the one with the animals inside a Civic shell......it IS a Civic isn't it? "
"smoot","November 2005"," http://automobiles.honda.com/element/index.aspxCrab and Platypus are funny... "
"ateixeira","November 2005"," They were so-so, a little slow paced. Hard to hear the audio, too.-juice "
"smoot","November 2005"," Lol!I wonder if Suzuki 4x4's are still on the Consumer Reports Deathwish List.A friend of mine audtioned for a new HumVee H3 ad....which sucks! A regular UPS guy walks into the Hummer HQ office and is looking for someone. The whole office is full of giants {top halves are off screen} walking past him. One of them looks down at him as he hands over the package. The giant puts his hands on his hips and goes 'Hmmm,'..fade to black....show H3 logo. Uh huh...wot a gem. "
"badgerfan","November 2005"," Oh no, the Christmas is coming. I suppose Lexus is going to be rolling out some more of those irritating bow wrapped Lexus ads that show you have to surprise your loved one with a Luxury Lexus for Christmas. Let us kneel at the alter of conspicuous consumption!Please, warn me first so I can go get my barf bag. "
"fintail","November 2005"," Yeah, those commercials are painfully ostentatious and pretentious. In my area, that means the local dealer should see a 300% increase in sales next month, as every mentally stunted irresponsible trophy wife around here has a RX that she wears like jewelry. "
"lemko","November 2005"," Those Lexus Xmas ads are in very bad taste especially in a city where many are worrying about paying for their heat this winter let alone splurging on a luxury vehicle for some undeserving money pit of a trophy wife. "
"ateixeira","November 2005"," Guys, tell us how you really feel!Besides, how do we know the successful business women aren't buying them for their slacker/drunk/useless husbands? :PI wish mine would. LOL -juice "
"ab348","November 2005"," Now, now... ""mentally stunted irresponsible trophy wife""? That's a bit harsh. The other day one of them in her RX followed me into a parking garage and we took the elevator together. I don't know if she was mentally stunted or irresponsible but she definitely was beautiful and charming and funny. I don't hold her driving a RX against her.  "
"fintail","November 2005"," Maybe they have a different image in your area. RX here is all about being pretentious. Probably good odds of betting you'll see one residing at any given face brick McMansion. "
"ateixeira","November 2005"," Wifey just ordered one of these, pretty nifty. I may be less active in this thread now. -juice "
"ab348","November 2005"," I have no doubt about the pretensiousness... anyone with a luxury SUV is likely that way. I object to the adjectives you used, that's all. Pretentiousness, while a flaw, is hardly a fatal flaw -- especially if you had seen the lady I was referring to! ;-)Back to bad ads: the Toyota truck ad where everything under the sun falls into the bed and the thing drives away unscathed is the latest in Toyota's dumb truck ad series. Not as bad as the meteor strike one, but close.Plus, why is it that all Suzuki Grand Viagra Vitara ads seem to run at about 20 decibels louder than the program they are sponsoring? I would never buy a Suzuki anyway, but their ads would clinch it for me if I was on the fence, they are that dumb, especially the cliff-diving businessman one. "
"lemko","November 2005"," When the cliffdiving businessman jumps over the edge, I first thought the song was ""Can't You Hear Me Knocking?"" by the Rolling Stones and then it turned out to be some stupid music by some unknown musicians. That Rolling Stones song alone would've rescued the Grand Vitara ad from vapid mediocrity. "
"anythngbutgm","November 2005"," O.K. I may be missing something, but have seen an ad for A Grand Caravan that has me totally scratching my head...Woman finds a Brown Teddy bear then proceeds to wash her car with it, slam it between her StownGO seats a few times, Slam on her brakes with the bear underneath (Road rash) and then rip out a button giving it one eye. ???Shoot to the next scene, little girl gets out of school Mom says, ""Hey, guess what I found today"". Girl lifts up the S n G compartment and finds the dirty, grimey destroyed bear and is ecstatic.Um... :confuse: OK "
"ateixeira","November 2005"," That was confusing to me at first, too. I think the mom is trying to buy a new doll to replace a lost one, then making it look like the old, ragged doll.Strange. :confuse: -juice "
"anythngbutgm","November 2005"," Oh, OK I get it. Makes sense. Still says nothing about the vehicle other than a teddy bear fits in a StownGo compartment? Not one of DMC's finest commercial attempts, but at least they are not using Snoop in the ads anymore  "
"ateixeira","November 2005"," Fo' Shizzle. -juice "
"john_324","November 2005"," Iacocca was getting on my nerves too...Though I bet that ad's probably come up in positive discussion over on the ""cars for moms"" thread...  "
"anythngbutgm","November 2005"," Saw the Giant Monster/Robot that gave birth to the H3 commercial again last night during CSI...My head hurts from trying to understand it. "
"pat","November 2005"," Wow, juice, that finally makes some sense!!That's one of the most obscure commercials I think I've ever seen. It was really bothering me - I thought the mother was being mean to the daughter by abusing the bear, although I couldn't make sense out of that at all.Wouldn't attract me to the Caravan, that's for daggoned sure. "
"fintail","November 2005"," I saw my first pretentious Lexus-wrapped-in-red-ribbons ads yesterday. Puke. I am also sick of the Toyota truck/meteor commercial, and they air one here that might be regional that has every car on the road being a Toyota, and that awful annoying song in the background.The new Dodge Ram one with the ""Hemi"" guy in it is also dopey, but I laugh anyway. He reminds me of Cousin Eddie from the ""Vacation"" movies, and that might not be a good persona to sell your cars. "
"ateixeira","November 2005"," The Hemi ads are interesting. I guess they're saying only hillbillies aspire to own them?-juice "
"stickguy","November 2005"," back on here too. THey must be having a bad year, because they are running prior years ads over again.Really a problem when the model they are showing isn't even made anymore! "
"toomanyfumes","November 2005"," I have seen those ads lately too. The one where the woman surprises her husband, It's the car that looks like a Camry. The commercial for the Ford F-150, where the two bulldozers push the front and back ends like a foot or so.Then the people get out. Big Deal. It's a dramazatation too,of course, making the ad even more pointless. "
"speterson1","November 2005"," Whaddaya think of the Jeep Commander commercial running these days with the family driving underwater, admiring all the sea life? That one really makes me scratch my head when the *only* thing the ad is conveying is utterly impossible to do. "
"1racefan","November 2005"," ""Really a problem when the model they are showing isn't even made anymore!""If they are going to recycle these ads with the previous models, they need to take advantage of plugging the Lexus certified pre-owned vehicles. "
"ateixeira","November 2005"," It's creative, though. Of course they're exaggerating, but they did with the Jeep in the snow, remember that one? Where the tip of the stop sign would stick out in the end of the ad?-juice "
"i_luv_toyota","November 2005"," Lexus just needs to stop airing ads altogether, especially in December! "
"john_324","November 2005"," It's interesting how Lexus seems to be fast becoming the gaudy luxury brand, and that their ads really seem to encourage this view.Back in the '80s and '90s, BMWs were the oft-derided ""yuppie"" cars, but at least the company's advertising didn't promote that image. "
"ateixeira","November 2005"," Or forget, any ways. The ads promote conspicuous consumption, I don't like them at all. They are like ads for jewelry.-juice "
"fintail","November 2005"," Jewelry is a very fitting comparison, especially for the local RX set "
"tmart","November 2005"," Come on now! The commercials don't promote conspicuous consumption any more than one for a Jag or Benz, Infinity, or any car in the upper price range. They're wanting you to buy the car. So what if one buys it for their spouse for Christmas. Wouldn't you like to receive a car from your spouse?? "
"lemko","November 2005"," ...if my girlfriend bought me a new Cadillac, I might marry her. I just hope other manufacturers don't follow Lexus' lead and make their own tasteless Xmas commercials. ""Merry Mercedes Xmas!!!"" ""Jaguar Jingle Bells Time!!!"" "
"toomanyfumes","November 2005"," bought me a Lexus,I would not be happy. I know who'd be making the payments on it!! "
"tmart","November 2005"," Actually, IIRC, Jag had a commercial using a big red bow on their car awhile back, very similar to the Lexus. Now they have the ""Gorgeous"" theme. "
"lemko","November 2005"," ...I mean she bought and paid for the car entirely. If she financed it, well heck, it's her credit, the dummy! I keep myself to a Xmas budget and leave the credit cards at home. Some dummies are still paying for Xmas from 5 years ago. If you're family and friends are so materialistic and greedy they expect lavish gifts, screw 'em! They deserve nothing! "
"ateixeira","November 2005"," I disagree.Giving a car as a ""gift"" is particularly conspicuous, because it implies that you can afford to make an impulse purchase without even consulting your spouse.So it's conspicuous consumption, and you're so filthy rich that money is not an issue that needs to be discussed with your spouse.I'd be peeved if my wife bought a car without my knowledge, whether it was for me or not.-juice "
"tmart","November 2005"," OK, let's agree to disagree. "
"badgerfan","December 2005"," If your girlfriend bought you a Caddy and you then married her because of what she bought you, then her car payments would become your payments as well!My wife would be really upset if I bought her a luxury car without consulting with her in advance, as would I be if she bought one for me. Even if her tastes ran to luxury, which they do not, she still would want some say in what was bought.I would be sleeping in the dog house, and we don't even have a doghouse! It wouldn't really even set well with her if I bought a sensible car for myself without consultation with her, and vice versa.The Lexus ads just seem much more obnoxious than the diamond jewelry ads, for some reason. I even have trouble stomaching their non holiday radio ads, as the voice inflections of the announcer are purposely chosen to infer that anyone buying a Lexus is more sophisticated than the average Joe, even if the ads are for buying a used Lexus. Oh, excuuuuse me, I shouldn't call it a ""used"" Lexus, it should be referred to as a ""preowned"" Lexus. "
"fintail","December 2005"," Speaking of ads, I notice 99% of the ads here at Edmunds are GM. Are they finally targeting the enthusiast set rather than the lowest common denominator? "
"ateixeira","December 2005"," My step-mom was watching Martha when I went over to visit, they were decorating Buick dealerships. It was hilarious.-juice "
"anythngbutgm","December 2005"," The Martha Stewart Apprentice? I flipped through that and got a kick out of the Lucerne at the dinner table. I remember chuckling to my wife looks like ""Matchstick"" brought the milk to the party...:D "
"ateixeira","December 2005"," Funny thing is Safeway grocery stores use that name for their dairy produts...and here they had a Lucerne at the dinner table. That idea was so dumb...no wonder they lost.-juice "
"151ranch","December 2005"," maybe it's like what my grandfather did - he bought his wife a brand new Cadillac. Problem was, she didn't know how to drive; guess who drove the Cadillac?She did eventually learn how - then she went and bought her own car. "
"ateixeira","December 2005"," Good idea, I think I'll give my wife...power tools! -juice "
"fintail","December 2005"," On the cover of one of the local free car classified rags you pick up at the store etc, the local Lexus dealer has a RX wrapped up in a bow parked in a living room. Great, it's in print too!I'd like to see the ad with an RX parked in a diamond ring box. "
"ateixeira","December 2005"," That's the name for the marketing campaign. I'm surprised the gold package isn't standard. -juice "

"gagrice","December 2005"," Crappy, uh, I mean Happy Honda Days are back!Honda & Lexus's attempt at political correctness is a real turn off for me. It is an attempt change the holiday to something it is not. At least GM included Santa Claus in their Red Tag ad. I think the average American feels assualted by these ads in poor taste. "

"i_luv_toyota","December 2005"," I'm amazed that Ford has found a way to use the Charlie Brown theme song for their sales event!Now I must ask, what exactly does Charlie Brown have to do with Ford?! "
"explorerx4","December 2005"," it's the 'peanuts' theme. if it was the 'charlie brown' theme, at least it wasn't the pigpen or lucy.  "
"speterson1","December 2005"," The title of that song is actually ""Linus & Lucy"", and I really dislike Ford for buying that song and then proceeding to use it on an ad that has nothing to do with Christmas whatsoever. That song is a treasured part of my childhood, and now it's a flippin' Ford ad. As Snoopy would say, BLEEEAAAH! "

"AG11","December 2005"," Year after year, the most annoying commercial around the holiday season is the Lexus' December to Remember series, but this year, they are surprisingly un-annoying...!  "
"tmart","December 2005"," Personally, I've never had a problem with them, but there are many in this forum that hate them. Guess one has to own a Lexus to like them. There are many much worse. I can't stand GM'S Red Tag Sale ones, especialy the one with the car carrier landing on the roof like Santa. Then it takes off littering the scene with red tags. "
"AG11","December 2005"," There's nothing wrong with their cars, it's just their end of the year commercials that I usually find annoying. Oddy enough, I find them more annoying than the Toyota-thon commercials! I can't stand GM's Red Tag Sale ones,GM commercials are forgettable, just like their cars Except for the Buick commercials: their new slogan, Beyond Precision is simply ridiculous! I can understand Beyond Precision for a Caddy, but for a Buick? "
"ateixeira","December 2005"," Buick can get away with that - for years they've scored well in reliability and quality surveys, right up there with Cadillac. I believe one of CR's Best Bets among used cars is the Buick Regal.-juice "
"fintail","December 2005"," Happy Honda-Days probably ranks worse than the pretentious Lexus ads.The Red Tag ads are very stupid for one big reason...a line that says you'll pay the price on the tag ""and not a penny more!"".

"AG11","December 2005"," That's precisely it. I can understand if Buick were touting their reliability or their value, but ""Beyond Precision"", to me, implies latest technology. "
"ab348","December 2005"," I find the current line of Nissan sale ads -- a similar series has been running for a while now -- extremely irritating. All those computer-generated images of various Nissan vehicles suddenly flipping over to be replaced by another or entering and exiting the frame, against a stark white background and accompanied by sound effects (thwack!). It's just jarring. "

"ateixeira","January 2006"," That's one's pretty silly, I believe when GM bought Saab they did not acquire the division that worked on aerospace, so it's more than a stretch.Ironically, the 9-2x is made in Gunma, Japan, at a Fuji plant, a company that still does have direct lineage to a airplane manufacturer.-juice "

This is a truly dorky commercial.I don't think cartoon characters can sell cars. Remember the Lumina commercial with Disney character bouncing out of the car...real lame. I have kids, but I'm the buying the car - not them! Leave the cartoon characters to selling breakfast cereals. "

"john_324","January 2006"," Yeah, that's a sweet ad. I love that ""hybrid concept vehicle"", whatever it is.In the same vein, even though I hate the vehicle, I like that new Hummer H3 ad where the parts all coalesce into the Hummer which then drives away.  "

"akuska1","April 2006"," > I have a different objection - VW didn't have a single car on the IIHS Gold list. No, but they have a bunch of cars on the Silver list (Jetta, Passat, Audi A3, Audi A4, Audi A6, Rabbit once it's released). They fall short of the Gold solely because of the rear crash ratings (they get the 2nd highest rating of ""Acceptable""), and the IIHS press releases make clear that the IIHS praises VW for its commitment to safety. On the frontal and side impact tests, the VWs do just as well, or better, than the 9-3, Civic, Impreza, Legacy, and Five Hundred.The crashes in the commercials are front and side-impact.BTW, Subaru is doing a lot of bragging right now about safety, as they should. They just do it the more conventional way (mentioning that they get the Gold award). "
"akuska1","April 2006"," Also, if you look at the sub-ratings within the side-impact crash test, the Jetta does better than every car with a Gold award (i.e. it gets sub-ratings of Good on every category - the first car tested to do so - while the Gold winners have at least one Acceptable sub-rating). Thus, the side-impact commercial is spot-on. Side-impact crash scores can be compared between categories, unlike frontal impact crash scores.On the frontal impact rating, VW is on slightly shakier ground, at least with the Jetta. It gets 4 out of 5 stars from NHTSA, and while it does get a ""Good"" from the IIHS, the individual ratings indicate a risk of injury to the lower leg. The Passat does better. It's too bad VW doesn't want to promote its active safety features the way Hyundai does. VW and Hyundai both provide stability control in their new small and mid-size cars. Honda doesn't make it available at all on the Civic. "

"i_luv_toyota","May 2006"," Since I live in Yankees country, Ford uses Derek Jeter to promote their cars and trucks.The one they show most often is one where Jeter welcomes the ""audience"" into his crib (his words, not mine). First we see a puny living room with a couch, TV and a pool table. After that, Jeter says, ""Now let me show you where all the action takes place!"" He then opens the door to his garage and we see a large collection of Ford cars (including the Ford GT). He then proceeds to showcase a few, including a Fusion, a Mustang GT and sometimes an Explorer Eddie Bauer edition. Jeter then says, ""I've got mine, now go get yours!""Another one which advertises Ford trucks shows Jeter lifting weights, but I can't remember anymore detail than that.Does anybody see these ads outside the greater NYC/NJ/CT area? They seem to run many times even when the Yankees aren't on. "

"4crrt","May 2006"," I agree, the commercial is moderately arrogant. I was looking at ""Hotel Rhawanda"" on television this weekend and there is a scene in it where the star said he bribed someone with a car to move his future wife to a clinic nearer to him. The wife kept pressing to find out what kind of car and he finally gave in and said, ""A Volkswagen."" Then they both laughed and she then said, ""It better have been a new one.""Funny thing is, it seems with the recent ads that VW is taking pride in this image.

I do like how whichever Yaris wasn't featured at the end pops out of the other one.What's noticable to me is that some Japanese car companies (Honda and Mitubishi) seem in their ads to have gone back to playing up that they're Japanese. The Eclipse ads with the drummers do so very strikingly, and the Fit ads seem to have a ""Godzilla"" style to them.

If they tout a new structural design leading to much better crashworthiness, does that make viewers feel invincible? My point exactly. The Jetta commercials do just that, and I haven't noticed an increase in deliberate VW crashes. Almost every ad these days has an element of ""fantasy"" regarding the vehicle's capabilities - see ""transformer"" conversation just before this. Anyone think the car can actually transform? Thought not.With TiVO and the handy ""mute"" button on most remotes, it's nigh-on impossible to get consumers to watch commercials as it is.

"jipster","September 2006"," If a commercial comes out touting airbags, would you say they are promoting unsafe driving behavior...I think that's a poor analogy. I have seen responsible ads showing how airbags work to prevent serious injury. These type of commercials do not give one the impression of invincibility. But, exaggerate the airbag ads to the extent of the Hyundai Sante FE ESC Slip N Slide ads ... and you would have a Hyundai crashing head first into a locomotive at 80 mph, and the driver of said Hyundai walking away without a scratch. According to you and Kirstie, these type of ads are acceptable. As I posted before, I do not believe the capabilities of safety features should be exaggerated or misrepresented. Could a Sante Fe with ESC go down a twisting mountainous road in conditions ""similar"" to those represented in the Slip N Slide commercial?

"i_luv_toyota","October 2006"," There's this new RAV4 commercial that strikes me as kind of odd.It features animated jewel thieves throwing their loot in the back of the RAV4. Then the RAV4 closes it's back door and takes off, leaving the thieves for the cops to chase after and catch. After they're caught, the RAV4 disappears into the night with all the diamonds (except one that falls out towards the end).I kind of like it, I just don't know what to make of it. I guess they are trying to go more ""Scion-like"" with their commercials/animations. "
"ateixeira","October 2006"," Yeah, saw it too. And they're trying to say it's hard to categorize?

"fintail","October 2006"," Hmmm I wonder if they would do a new retro car. The Defender was kind of retro. "
"british_rover","October 2006"," The defender was just the continuation of the Series Land Rovers.For example the door handles on our 1959 Rover will work on a Defender.Almost the whole door on a series Rover will bolt up to a defender.The frames are even very simliar just modern metalurgy for the Defender.The Defender should come back within the next three to four years on the T5 platform that the LR3 and Range Rover Sport share.

"british_rover","October 2006"," Funny how they basicly skipped over the 1980s and 1990s with the exeption of the Allente.Wonder why they would do that? "
"fintail","October 2006"," Well, they had the bustleback Seville, which in a twisted way, I like.But yeah, bleak times. "
"lemko","October 2006"," Heck, I'm not even a big Mercedes fan and I get a bit choked up when the car is shown going to the crusher after all the life events that car went through. Anyway, per the Cadillac ad, they should've used my 1989 Cadillac Brougham in the ad for the '80s. It still is an excellent car. I'd shown a few more cars from the '30s and '60s in the ad than they did. "
"fintail","October 2006"," Always think, when you see some old heap...it was once someone's new car. And that car got reborn!Nothing wrong with a Brougham, yeah. And I didn't like how they had that 56 (I think it was) and then a 59...not enough of a gap. They should have had a 48-49 as well, or a 53 Eldo. I was shocked it had the bustleback, I thought most people still laughed at those.Here are a few more good ads:Optimistic mileage claimsCamcord competitor?

"ateixeira","October 2006"," That K-car as is great...very clever.The Caddy ad is neat, but doesn't tug at the heartstrings like Benz ads do.-juice "
"ateixeira","October 2006"," The Tempo ad was weird. Funny how styling alone is not enough, you need a competent car underneath it all. Taurus was a big success but the Tempo was such a flop. Back then one of my friends had one and simply could not give it away when it was 2 years old and he had it for sale. Noone wanted it.Also remember the Under-Achieva, another flop. Quad 4 has to be the most redundant name ever (even though the 4 meant 4 valves per cylinder, and Quad meant 4 cylinders). Almost as bad as using the 4-4-2 name on the Calais.Regal, I remember that campaign, too. Never mind the goofy digital dash and the silly seatbelts on the door, what was GM thinking building GM10s as coupes only at the start? How much volume did they really expect?Even worse, the sedans look rushed and incongruous. A band-aid at best.Precis - very rare, they never sold like the Hyundai Excel twin did. I guess Mitsu got that car because they supplied the engines to Hyundai at first. Both were such crap, though.Gremlin - no wonder Honda and Toyota made such inroads in that era.2CV - someone actually owns one of those in my garage. Must I mention he's French and eccentric (or is that redundant?). -juice "
"fintail","October 2006"," Funny about the Tempo...that ad claims such huge mileage...we had one back in the day, and I don't think it ever broke 30mpg in any driving. It was an auto mind you, but still. In 1985 my mother had to do some long distance commuting, and bought a 4cyl car. She bought the most loaded old style Tempo I've ever seen...a medium blue GLX with what I believe was every option. She bought it late in the model year, so she might have got a deal. It was actually very reliable until 120K or so, but then started having issues. Key was that ""computer"" the commercial mentions, which would fail every 6 months or so, no matter who worked on it. Defective engineering. It also had some electrical glitches (power seat started smoking when I was driving it, that was cool), small gasket/seal leaks, etc, and it started rusting at the tops of the doors. The car was driven long distances for several years as a commuter, then relegated to a second car, then a kids car. I beat the hell out of it as a teen, and it never failed on me. My favorite tricks were revving it way up and dropping it into gear, and pegging the sad speedo (I swear it topped out at 80mph) just for laughs. It was SO slow, and it only sounded good when the exhaust rusted away (I'm on the west coast...things don't rust so much here). When the car was 14 years old, at 190K, all the kids were out of the house, so my mom sold it to some guy for $600. I saw it about a year ago, still looked OK.I knew a girl who got a new Achieva right out of high school. I think they had to lemon law it, she had lots of issues. Last time I knew, she had a Toyota...Precis didn't crash well either, that's what happened to my friend's example. With how bad those things were, it's sometimes amazing Hyundai is still here.Unfortunately, I can't seem to locate a 'Cadillac, Cadillac, Cadillac Style' ad. "
"lemko","October 2006"," Cadillac ad could've been worse. They could've included a Cimmaron, a V-8-6-4, and a Diesel! Odd they used the Allante as the only good one was the last 1993 model. A 1992-7 or 1998-9 Seville STS would've been a better choice for the 1990s. The Cadillac cars I'd have used for that ad would've been:1933 V-16 Phaeton1941 Sixty-Special1949 Coupe DeVille1953 Eldorado1956 Series 62 hardtop or convertible1959 Eldorado1963 Sedan DeVille1967 Eldorado1971 Eldorado1976 Seville1979 Coupe DeVille1989 Brougham1992 Seville STS1996 Fleetwood Brougham2002 Seville STS2007 XLR-V "
"fintail","October 2006"," I can go with that...but maybe a CTS or something instead of a 2002 STS, as to the average non-car person, I suspect a 92 STS and an 02 STS are pretty identical.Some of them, like the 49 and the 76 Seville are very deserving. "
"ateixeira","November 2006"," Agree 100% about the Excel very nearly ruining Hyundai.For a while it was the best selling import model, but I guess it caught up to them. Took Hyundai nearly 2 decades to earn people's trust again, they're doing better now.-juice "

"carlisimo","November 2006"," Datsun's ""black gold"" ad - the epitome of manliness "
"andre1969","November 2006"," one thing to keep in mind is that in 1984, the EPA rated cars differently. I think they just published their raw, unadjusted test numbers, which were much more optimistic than what most people were really getting. For 1985 they adjusted them down to a more realistic number. That year, it was EPA rated at 25/34 with the 5-speed manual and 25/29 with the automatic, which was a 3-speed with no OD. There was a Diesel 5-speed that was rated at 36/44.My stepdad bought a 1984 Tempo brand new. I remember driving it once. I hated it with a passion. It was slow, and for being a small car it just didn't feel very nimble. At the time my regular car was a 1980 Malibu coupe with a V-6, hardly a musclecar, but it felt like a rocket compared to that Tempo! Actually felt more responsive too, when it came to handling, cornering, and such.As for popularity, the Tempo was a pretty strong seller its first few years out. In 1985 it was one of the top ten selling car nameplates in America. It fell off fast though, especially once the Japanese competition started getting larger. The Corsica/Beretta, which were wildly popular for their first few years, probably stole a lot of Tempo sales, as did Chrysler's increasingly wide array of K-car permutations.It seems like whenever they came out with that restyle, which I think was in 1988, the car was pretty much relegated to rental fleets and bargain-basement buyers. I had a friend from middle school whose Dad actually bought two of the things! He was well-off financially but tended to really cheap out when it came to cars. They lived in what was once the nicest neighborhood around at the time, but in 1983-84 were driving a 1972 Satellite wagon and a 1971 or so Comet coupe. Last time I saw his Dad around 1990 or so, they had ""upgraded"" to ~1988 Tempos.I hated my stepdad's Tempo with a passion, but it actually did make it to about 160,000 miles on its original driveline, when they traded it for a 1991 Stanza. It had other problems I'm sure, but the driveline was actually pretty solid. Ford had two different 2.3 4-cylinders back then. They had an OHC unit sourced from Brazil that was used in cars like the Pinto, Mustang, and Fairmont, and turbo'ed for cars like the T-bird, but for some reason in the Tempo they just took an old Falcon pushrod 6 and chopped two cylinders off!

"somuchjackson","January 2007"," The helicopter commercial that people were mentioning earlier flat out lied. It is the commercial where a black lexus is dropped from a helicopter 4000 ft off of the ground. It is supposed to hit the ground 5 seconds later. Another white lexus stands 4000 ft away from where the black lexus is to land. As the black lexus is released, the engine is gunned on the white lexus. The white lexus just clears the bullseye an instant before the black lexus crashes on the target. However, with a common equation and knowledge of gravity, the falling lexus simply wouldn't travel 4000 ft in 5 seconds. In 5 seconds, the car would only fall 400 feet. Lexus is off by a factor of 10. See the first equation on this sitehttp://www2.glenbrook.k12.il.us/gbssci/phys/Class/1DKin/U1L6b.htmland plug in 32.17ft/s^2 for ""a"" and 5s for ""t"" if you want to check for yourself.

"xcargrl","March 2007"," Ritter takes helm of Toyota's U.S. ad agencyMark Rechtin | Automotive News / March 20, 2007 - 4:28 pm LOS ANGELES -- Toyota's U.S. advertising agency is seeing a change in the executive suite.David Murphy -- president of the Saatchi & Saatchi Los Angeles office, is leaving the agency to start his own firm. The Los Angeles office oversees the Toyota account.Taking Murphy's place is Kurt Ritter, former marketing general manager of General Motors' Chevrolet division. Ritter left GM in 2003. Ritter's title will be CEO of Saatchi & Saatchi Los Angeles.When Ritter left GM, he was set to oversee the Toyota account for Saatchi. But when GM accused Saatchi's holding company, Publicis Groupe, of poaching Ritter -- and unsubtly threatened to divert GM business from Publicis' other agencies -- Ritter's role was changed to that of an off-site consultant.For the past four years, Ritter technically has not been a Saatchi employee. But his consulting firm, Against All Odds, had only Saatchi as a client. Ritter also was on Saatchi's worldwide executive board -- the only nonemployee on the board.Ritter, 57, brings extensive truck marketing experience to Saatchi at a time when Toyota is feverishly launching its full-sized Tundra pickup. While at Chevrolet, Ritter orchestrated the successful ""Like A Rock"" marketing campaign.Ritter was unavailable for comment.You may e-mail Mark Rechtin at [email?protected] "

It blows me away Toyota is spending billions on marketing, advertising, and incentives to dealers on the new Tundra yet saying they are not trying to take away sales from GM and Ford. Maybe the new Tundra is a good truck but it seems to me Toyota is really buying their way into the US full size truck market and talking out of the other side of their mouth about being such a green company. Something is wrong with the picture. :confuse: "

"xcargrl","March 2007"," So basically Toyota shouldn't be allowed to compete in the truck market...I'm not saying they shouldn't compete. Toyota will compete and the auto industry is all the better for it; they are extremely competitive regardless of what is communicated in the press about not going after the #1 slot. BUT, their execs are also constantly talking about the company's contributions to society and minimizing their footprint on the environment. So to make a corporate decision to build the new Tundra in the US counters the image they try to portray--in my opinion.How many gas guzzling full size trucks/SUV's does Toyota have in their entire stable? I can count 5 (Sequoia, Tundra, GX470, Land Cruiser, LX470)... ...And they should stick with that number. And as far as GM, Ford and DCX is concerned, it's obscene how many gas guzzlers they have in their fleets.

Same goes for propaganda spread by companies like Consumer Reports.It does seem strange that Toyota would build a huge new factory to assemble 250,000 Tundra trucks this year and no assembly plants for the vehicle that has falsely given them a green image, the PRIUS. At least Honda can hold up their head when they say they are a green company. Same cannot be said of Toyota. For those that get sucked into believing the Toyota advertising, I say go for it. Don't cry on Edmund's 10 years from now when the truck has fallen apart. Most major environmentalist groups are not buying the green image Toyota would like to portray in their phony ads.

Their CEO has gone as far as saying he would reduce incentives so as not to hurt domestic car makers, yet the incentives never actually dropped.Just SHUT UP about it, already.Toyota's CEO has a duty to their share holders to maximize profit any way they can, and if it means intentionally burying weaker competitors then it is their DUTY to try to do exactly that.I get miffed that they pretend they're not. :mad: "

"anythngbutgm","November 2007"," OK, I like some of the new commercials for the F-150. They're informative, they're catchy and they really hit the target, marketing wise.But, does anyone actually believe it can stop a 30k lb cargo plane?

"anythngbutgm","November 2007"," I believe the song you are thinking of is called ""True Nature"" and it was used in a Cooper tire commercial. And yes, that is Perry Farrell with Jane's addiction. It's a pretty kickin song but the rest of the album is garbage IMO. Buy the song from itunes :shades: "
"speterson1","November 2007"," ...must...defend...artists I like....Although the album ""Strays"" which has ""True Nature"" is labelled as Jane's Addiction, without Eric Avery, the original bass player, that band is only a shadow of the real Jane's Addiction. Not convinced? Check out Eric's other work on the album ""Deconstruction"" (which also has Dave Navarro on it, awesome stuff) and with his follow-up band, Polar Bear, especially the ""Chewing Gum"" EP if you can get your hands on it. To get back on topic somewhat, the album art for Deconstruction is car-themed and pretty cool; there's a dangling engine on the cover, and in the liner notes, instead of a photo each of the three musicians is represented with a different auto part. If I recall correctly, Eric = distributor or an alternator, Dave Navarro = spark plug, and drummer Mike Murphy = air or oil filter. I assume that their representative car parts were symbolic of their roles in the band, interesting food for thought./end music geek rant/ "
"anythngbutgm","November 2007"," My apologies. I typed that out so quickly, I didn't realize how blunt I was being. I was a big Jane's fan back in the day, saw a few shows, including Lollapalooza but it was only a handful of songs which I got attached to. I prefered the heavier stuff to the experiemental, trippy tunes which is probably why I made such a harsh comment. From a band perspective, Jane's was cutting edge. Dave Navarro is a great guitarist, really the some of the best stuff came out of the RHCP when he was on board IMO. I meant no disrespect, it's just been a while since I've actually listened to them (""Jane says"" makes me want to drive off a cliff when it comes on the radio)btw, Deconstruction was awesome, I totally forgot about that one! And I have no clue as to how Farrell found Nuno Bettencourt and decided to make an album, that is probably the most oddball combination I have ever heard since Axel Rose did the gig with Elton John.Anyways, let me retract my comment, ""True Nature"" is a kickin tune, I went on the hunt trying to figure it out when I saw the commercial myself.-Utter music freak- "

I think it's in extremely poor taste to air such commercials due to the rotten economy. Spoiled? You don't realize what they go through. Many young girls start out desiring a pony and then get a horse and then have to take dressage lessons. They learn discipline and responsibility during the lessons, doing many grueling hours of practice, competing in events and taking care of their horses by brushing them, cleaning their hooves, etc. This develops character and humility. If their horse is not on the parent's property, then the mother usually drives them to the barn/horse farm. Mother has responsibility to always seek out the best trainer for her daughter(s) as well as proper bridle, saddle, helmet and riding clothes. And, that is not all. It is likely that the daughter(s) are also learning tennis, golf, soccer and competing in same. It is a very trying schedule for mother and daughter(s). Tough on the mother also if 2 or more daughters have horses.People that can afford Lexus, Mercedes, Infiniti, even Cadillac, need to see TV commercials to stimulate them into buying. Look at all the jobs created whether in the U.S. or elsewhere for global economy.Have not seen the Cadillac Christmas commercial yet. They have not recently run the commercial with the young woman in a CTS kind of racing two guys in another car. That's neat, showing up the guys. "

It's the upkeep that might be a problem for some people.Minimum for boarding a horse in my area is $300/month + periodic shoeing and vet bills. Of course if you have a farm, or a suitably large and zoned property, you can have your horse(s) in your own barn, but then have to do at least twice daily maintenance and also let the horse out in the pasture during the day.On Lexus Christmas commercials, saw one the other night of a woman apparently giving her guy (husband?) a white Lexus with red bow in front of their (presumably) modest house.

That is pretty good, but still not the imagination of the Lexus RX Christmas commercials which tug at the heart strings. Last Christmas was best of series with a flashback of young girl getting a pony, then getting an RX for Christmas currently as adult. That is marketting.What about being a senior in a sun city area and driving a golf cart locally and a Buick Lucerne for out of area. Hey, maybe a good idea for a commercial for Buick. They could show a senior couple getting into their Lucerne in the driveway in front of the garage doors with a high-end golf cart parked nearby with clubs in it. "
"fintail","March 2009"," Yeah, those MB Christmas spots ring a bell...maybe I wasn't paying attention. I know MB has copied the now legendary Lexus December sales events.Maybe my heart is colder...Stepford wives/kept women/whipped consumeristic ""men"" don't tug at my heart. Those ads seem to be about materialism and living above one's means...the cars seem to be hanging around a house you just know would be over-bought. The RX and maybe LX have a world built around them now.And I still can't get over a not-very-old guy who was supposed to be enthused over an ES. Give me a break.This tugs at my heartThis is nice and sentimental tooFor Buick, maybe a good promo could be buy a new Lucerne at sticker, get a nice golf cart for free. I bet a lot of the target market for those doesn't negotiate very hard anyway... "
"ateixeira","March 2009"," The new Chevy ads with ""manly"" Howie Long are really biting. He makes fun of the Ford tailgate step and the Tundra's V6 gas mileage.Honestly that must be the dumbest ad ever.

"xrunner2","March 2009"," Lots of dopey commercials in northern Illinois on Cubs radio station WGN for Chevy. Wonder why loser Cubs have tie-in to Chevy commercials. Wait a minute.

"kyfdx","April 2009"," I think it's two payments.... the program varies on models, etc.. Maximum of $750 per payment, so an incentive of around $1500...They've had much bigger incentives than that, though in other forms.. 0.9% financing for 60 months on most of the model lineup at one time or the other in the last year.... That's a $4000 incentive on a loan of $40K... $3000 on 335i sedans right now... $4000 on X3s... Nothing new for BMW... They've incentivized cars through cheap leases for years.. "

I remember a few years back that Wendy's fast food chain sales had dropped like a rock, forcing them to get rid of their ""Mr. Wendy"" campaign, which apparently was a major cause of the falling sales.

Lame.Lots of Jeep drivers are real off roaders too...but there's a ""look at me"" crowd which is annoying, and IMO the latest commercial slogan is aimed at. The real die-hards don't need a commercial like that.The ""fairy lights"" comment is amusing. The LED running light trend will end up being recorded like tailfins. Speaking of annoying people, it seems the new trend for ""[non-permissible content removed]"" cars is moving away from BMW and towards Audi and turbo Subarus. "
"ateixeira","November 2009"," That's funny.We used to have a very niche-like, tight community, but Subaru expanded a lot when the WRX came out and now they've gone pretty mainstream with the bigger Forester and Outback.Success from a sales standpoint, but it's not quite the tight-knit community it used to be.And Subaru, once the wagon expert of the world - no longer sells a single true station wagon here.The OB is a crossover now, Forester is basically a small SUV, and there is no more Legacy wagon, plus the WRX is a 5 door hatch.No more wagons.

Mean-spirited and anti-Christmas.There is a bank commercial that is kind of a take-off of a Lexus commercial from last year using a pony. A man has two young girls (6 years old?) sitting at a table. He asks first one if she wants a pony. She says yes and he gives her a toy model of a pony. He asks second girl, she says yes and he brings out a live pony. First girl then says to him that he didn't ask her if she wanted a real live pony. The mean man then says, ""You didn't ask"". First girl then has sorrowful expression. Got to wonder. Were those girls acting, or not? If not, then very questionable using children like that. "

"tmart","December 2009"," Mainly its the suspension differences, I think. The C70 feels alot more irregular road surfaces that the ES300 ignores. Even with the better seats in the Volvo, you feel a lot of bumps. BUT, with the top down and the SC901 cranking, one forgets about the bumps! :shades: "

Kind of similar to other car makers showing a lot of customer traffic in their showrooms. One of dumbest car commercials is that of a car crashing through the windows into the showroom - was that Mercedes? Now that does not make any sense at all, is pointless and reflects poorly on the car manufacturer involved.The dumbest commercials are car makers that show their car driving on desert floor, dust/sand being kicked up, then car goes sliding every which way.

"fintail","December 2009"," If the spot was meant as a parody toward previous lame Toyota commercials, I could see it....but they are serious, I fear.The MB ad makes sense in the context of the ad copy. The new E coupe is touted as a new member in a long line of MB sports coupes (although in most variants you'll see on the road, it isn't the sportiest thing) - and it crashes onto the scene in a display of sporty cars at the MB museum (perhaps the best maker-sponsored museum in the world). It doesn't seem out of line to me. It's better than Lexus cars shown in front of pretentious shops, no matter that ""apartment and condo trash"" as someone put it, purchase a great deal of them. A good RX ad would have an affluent non-working free-spending housewife cruising between the gallery mall and the botox clinic...maybe an LS ad featuring the same driver unable to park the big car properly and destroying the wheels along the curb :shades: I don't like ads that show cars on shiny wet roads on sunny days, and the cars always appear perfectly clean.

"anythngbutgm","September 2010"," And I agree, and that's fine but... that's one car.By ""Standard"" I assume they are (in typical GM arrogant form) calling themselves the level at which is superior to all others, in all areas, in all categories. That's a ""Standard"" in my book and Cadillac is... to put it lightly... not there. As good as the CTS'V is performance-wise, I don't think Rolls Royce, Bentley, Lamborghini, Ferrari, Aston, etc. look to Cadillac as superior by any means. I highly doubt Land Rover or Mercedes look at a Blinged out gangsta mobile (Escalade) as superior. And I don't think that Maybach, Mercedes, BMW look at the Deville or Seville as credible competitors. Cadillac doesn't match any of these guys in quality, features, styling, amenities, advanced technologies, nor exotic materials. Even in mainstream brands, I don't think Subaru nor Audi looks at Caddy as a ""Standard"" when it comes to AWD prowess, safety nor value.The only other thing they built that could be looked at as a possible standard would have been the now defunct SRX but even that went from a credible barn burner to a fwd based Generi-nox and it's anemic engines are not what I would call ""Standard"" (Superior) by an means...My point, calling one self as a ""Standard"" is pretty optimistic IMO. Especially when you've got only one model (debatable) to back up such claims. :lemon:FWIW, ""The New class of World class"" comes off just as arrogant. One copycat ES car, a blown up Lambda clone and an overpriced, underpowered slug from Germany are not exactly leadership material... Maybe the ""New class"" in GM speak is pseudo-World Class? "
"ateixeira","September 2010"," Well, let's look at Audi, who is growing the fastest and poised to take over BMW in global volume...Sure the S5 is nice, but they sell more FWD A3 hatchbacks, and don't those come with tiny base engines overseas?Heck, arguably CTS > A4 when you consider the FWD 4 bangers they sell around the world.I'm not saying Cadillac is the standard of the world, but I do think it's no longer absurd to say that when they compare favorably to a segment growth leader like Audi.

They didn't expect that Tercel to last 200k miles, but it did.Sure, I'd rather drive an M3. Of course. But maybe not if I was driving to the hospital with broken ribs. Toyotas have a velvet-smooth ride that actually appeals to some people.Not everyone wants to drive a stiff sports sedan with rock-hard low-profile run-flat tires, folks! "

"ateixeira","October 2010"," Those ads were definitely tongue-in-cheek, but I think that's fairly obvious.Remember, the ad went viral - Toyota got over 7 million hits on YouTube.

Grand Caravan actually came in 2nd with 8057 sales. And both had good months!Sienna prices are up about $2000 across the board, so Toyota is selling 50% more vans at higher prices to boot.Total cash cow.Sorry to anyone who doesn't like the Swagger Wagon ads, but the fact is - it's probably the most effective campaign of this century. No kidding. "

"fintail","October 2010"," Well, to be fair, the current Odyssey is ancient and in desperate need of the new model, and it is also expensive.

"fintail","October 2010"," Yeah, a lot of Hyun-Kia products have guts in common, and they all look pretty different. The domestics could learn something from that.There must be less Kia dealers as a whole, so no doubt it will sell less unless it becomes a rental queen. "

They didn't break $40k after discounts before. $38-39k was loaded AWD before.It's a pretty clear-cut $2000 across-the-board increase in price, at least.

Even in Europe, they use the same system.Barcodes aren't used out here for anything other than rentals as far as I know - toll systems are RFID based and gated communities are like hens teeth.

Bar none.If you've ever had cracked ribs, like I have, you may better understand (appreciate, even) the benefits of total ride isolation. You could not have paid me to ride home in a BMW 3 series, I'd have called a cab if that's all I had access to.The thing enthusiasts simply don't understand is that some buyers want the quiet, comfortable isolation that the ES offers.

"fushigi","November 2010"," Well, not to rain on the EV parade but there are a couple of important factors to consider.First, city cars have had only limited success in the US. And make no mistake, that's all the Leaf - or any EV - can be until the range tops at least 250MPC and charge times are reduced to under 15 minutes.Real-world example: While I live & work in the Chicago suburbs I occasionally have to go to our downtown Chicago office. The round trip is 88 miles. The Leaf is unsuitable to this commute unless I have guaranteed access to a charger downtown. After all, the Leaf's max range is achieved with minimal accessory usage (radio, HVAC, wipers, lights, rear defrost, etc.) and that minimal usage is simply not compatible with the drive. Especially in winter since range is additionally reduced in cold weather.Second is the price. After $7500 in government incentives (which won't be permanent) the Leaf is still over $25K for a base model. Contrast with, say, the Fiesta which starts at just over $13K or Nissan's own Versa which can be had in stripped form for under $10K. It'll take a lot of years of duty - probably more than the vehicle's useful life - to even come close to making up the difference in cost.Don't forget the home charger needs a licensed electrician to install. Add another $1200-2000 up front for the charger & dedicated 240V circuit. Some consumers would have to add even more as they might need to upgrade their home's circuit box and possibly even the feed from the utility to the home. A 100 amp panel is not going to be able to support a home + a Leaf.Third, if you park on the street & not in a driveway or garage, forget it. The charge cable won't reach from a house to the street and even if it did you'd have to run it across a sidewalk, which may be illegal as it could block or impede sidewalk usage by wheelchairs.And fourth: The charger installation will take the Leaf off the list of many folks who rent. Unless a landlord agrees to subsidize the cost (and what's in it for them?), a tenant would be stuck paying for the charger & either leaving it or paying for it to be removed when they move.The Leaf will sell. There are some consumers who are homeowners with garages who have the income and value assumed eco-friendliness over cost. But as a value proposition, the Leaf fails. The above are issues for all EVs, but specific to Nissan there's also some history to consider. Nissan has not previously supported their own hybrid particularly well. After being on the market for over 4 years, the Altima Hybrid is still only available in a handful of states. "
"stickguy","November 2010"," they always seem to make a lot more sense to me for commercial use. The post office is the perfect situation. Central parking every night, and not many miles of all around town driving. I am sure other municipal services would fit in the same catagory. But, for normal users, very limited, and you would have to have another car (or easy access to one).I suppose if you live in the city and mostly stay local, it would be fine (with a garage to charge it) as long as you don't mind renting whenever you need to go someplace out of town.so I guess a Leaf + zipcar would work? Just seems a very expensive solution for what you get. "

While there, the folks bought an old milk can to take with us - so I had to share space with that, as well!A neighbor down the street from us had an early 70's Plymouth Satellite wagon .... white with fake woodgrain.

The Highlander is a good seller because it does exactly what it's intended to do, get the family back and forth from their destination in comfort, reliably, and while getting very respectable (if not class leading) fuel mileage. It's been Toyotas mission since the beginning. And in typical Toyota fashion, cars like the Highlander are designed because Toyota understands its intended market and more or less... nails it.I'm an enthusiast and Toyotas do very little to crank up my excitement meter, but if my wife wanted a Highlander as a commuter and we had kids, I would certainly give it a chance.

I think you've severely understimated just how far Hyundai has come and the real threat that they pose to the luxury segment. The Equus is a stepping stone that has the potential to shake up the market the same way the LS400 did for Lexus back in 1990. RWD, big V8 power, luxury touches found in more expensive Benzes, Audi models, even Maybachs, at a fraction of the cost? Features not even offered in any of the above mentioned? My gosh, even your favorite Cadillac brand doesn't have a flagship that matches it... "

Hyundai was foolish and short-sighted enough to brand it as a Hyundai. Didn't they learn anything from the Phaeton fiasco? I could design and manufacture the most exquisite handbag made of leather and fabrics superior than anything made by Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Coach, Fendi, etc., but what fashionable, wealthy woman of discerning taste is going to want a Lemko bag especially if I was previously known as the manufacturer who provided cheap vinyl purses to stores like Wal~Mart and Target?

"fintail","January 2011"," I don't buy the ""threat"" either - from something with no established track record in that part of the market.

Good God, you think they'd do something about that front end?

"anythngbutgm","January 2011"," Hyundai was foolish and short-sighted enough to brand it as a Hyundai. Didn't they learn anything from the Phaeton fiasco?So do you think that Hyundai should have started a whole new brand name just to market the Equus (Not a fan of the name btw...)? I can see some merit to that idea but with partial ownership of Kia taking up the lower market, the goal of Hyundai seems to be moving upmarket with offerings like the Equus to establish real credibility in the segment just as Lexus did in 1990.Or... do you discredit this model for the fact that it's not a domestic nameplate...The thing about the Phaeton that was short-sighted was the fact that VW was pitching a vehicle based on an Audi as an alternative to none other than... the Audi A8. This was due to infighting between the Audi/Porsche/VW management which never seems to be in agreement IMO.Also, VW went even further trying to differentiate the Phaeton and the Audi with a brand new engine family (""W"" series, in the case of the Phaeton a W8) which was really no better than the tried-and-true, time-tested (say that 5 times fast  ) 3.0l V6 and excellent 4.2l V8 (Wards best winner) in the Audi. And if I recall correctly, the W8 was terrible gas mileage wise...I predict the Equus will fair better than the Phaeton. Could be in for a surprise. :shades: "
"lemko","January 2011"," Why didn't they simply follow Lexus' lead? They didn't market their flagship as the Toyota LS400 though the same model was know as a Toyota in the JDM. Heck, Mazda proposed its own luxury brand Amati in the early 1990s. The idea was shelved when the economy soured. One result was the rather attractive 1992 Mazda 929 which was supposed to have been an Amati. ""Equus"" alone is a terrible name as it literally means ""horse."" It also conjures up the bizarre play by that name and the less weird movie starring Richard Burton. Maybe they should've called this car the ""Genesis (some alphanumeric)."" It would've been a lot better than ""Hyundai Equus.""I'm glad the domestics didn't come out with something like this. A bland body with a grotesque front end is something they don't need. If this had been a Caddy, Lincoln, or Chrysler, the critics would've slammed it unmercifully. You, yourself, would've had a field day laughing at the folly of the domestics trying to compete with M-B, BMW, Audi, and Lexus with something as silly as the Equus. If Cadillac wants to pursue a flagship, it should be something like the V-16 concept. If Buick wants to beat the Equus, it can simply build one of its upscale Chinese versions here. I've seen pictures of the Chinese LaCrosse and it's darn nicer looking than the Equus!The Phaeton is also much prettier than the Equus. It's just sad they called it a VW Phaeton. If you thought the W-8 was complex, the W-12 was fiendishly complex. I pity anybody who bought a Phaeton with either of these engines. They would be repenting their sins if and when something goes awry. "
"ateixeira","January 2011"," I predict the Equus will fair better than the Phaeton. Could be in for a surprise.Keep in mind these are very low volume cars, but it already has.Comparing first months for sale in the USA, Equus did about triple the volume of the Phaeton (and no, that's not saying much).Equus' first month also beat the Phaeton's 2nd month (after supply had a chance to ramp up) by about 50%.I see it more as a chauffer-driven limo, though, vs. a large luxury car. The [non-permissible content removed] child of a Mayback and a Lincoln Town Car, perhaps.Hyundai could do volume if they target fleets. "
"anythngbutgm","January 2011"," So it sounds like the styling is your biggest criticism of the big Hyundai then...I can understand that but when we look back on the LS400, it had a pretty similar profile as well. No crazy angles, no racy wings or lower cladding, just a classy, purposeful look similar to what Benz had been doing with the E-class up until then. Your right though, that grill has been met with some serious criticism. either people love it for it's originality or hate it for it's ""in-your-face"" appearance. I personally like it, it's not a Japanese looking design and I can easily identify it as a Hyundai product. You are also correct about the complexity of the ""W"" engines. I think VW has pretty much abandoned the family... I think they turned out to be pretty reliable though, not much in the way of recalls if I remember. "
"ateixeira","January 2011"," Actually it was the Mazda Millenia that was supposed to be the Amati.The current Equus is a quick adaptation of an existing Korean market car. The next one will be ground-up and should be a lot better.Rome wasn't built in a day. "
"fintail","January 2011"," Fleets could be a savior for the Equus, maybe a step up from a TC (for however long it may exist) as a DTS seems small for that service and other large cars too expensive.That's another stumbling block H has presented itself in the premium area - the better version is always just around the corner. Wait for the better engine or better suspension or nicer design. Not the best way to build any kind of image or prestige.Still haven't seen one on the road, and I don't imagine I will anytime soon. "
"ateixeira","January 2011"," They have a modern multi-valve V8 already. I think it's getting DI if it didn't already get it.Come to think of it, it may have been the Genesis that was waiting for that upgrade. "
"fintail","January 2011"," Genesis waited for suspension retuning and the engine you mention, I've read there's a better engine supposedly coming for Equus too...along with an eventual restyle that has to be less of a mix of bland and awkward. Knowing that, why would one buy now? "
"lemko","January 2011"," The TC has degenerated into a deluxe Crown Vic or a slightly nicer Mercury Grand Marquis. Sad, because I remember when a Town Car was a truly plush car. I agree the DTS is a bit too small for livery work. I've seen DTS's stretched into limos, but the proportions are awkward. I hate when I see SUVs stretched into limos. The only person who'd think something like that had any class is a ""Jerry Springer Show"" guest who suddenly hit the lottery. The Mercedes S550 and S600 would make excellent limousines, but few livery companies could afford them. "
"ateixeira","January 2011"," The guy being driven around may not care much.I see this Equus as a stop-gap, until the all-new model arrives.I'm actually surprised Hyundai brought it here in the first place. "
"fintail","January 2011"," If it does get made into a livery special, that won't help the image either.I think some Hyundai execs have inflated egos. "
"lemko","January 2011"," ...like Ferdinand Piech and the Phaeton? "
"fintail","January 2011"," Even when I was a kid, the TC was a very plush car, indicative of a little money. I lived in a podunk area with the nearest German lux car dealer a couple hours away - the money there drove a lot of TCs and Caddys.Nothing says classless like a stretched Hummer.S class and 7er are used as livery vehicles in Germany, but I suspect they are just late model ex-rentals. "
"fintail","January 2011"," Phaeton still sells, albeit slowly, in Europe.But yeah, they bit off more than they could chew. "
"fezo","January 2011"," Back on the commercial front, Mike whathisname and his ford commercials are really annoying! They seem to be getting worse.I get that Ford is now fully competitive but this concept that runs through all of them that one should be embarrassed driving a Honda or Toyota when there is such a thing as a Ford is hogwash and it grows tiresome.Some would say if the commercial reminds me of the product that it's a good commercial. Generally I agree with that concept but in this case the ads are so much like fingernails on a chalkboard that they are making it far less likely that I'd be saying ""maybe I'll go look at a Ford."" Killer is that without the ads at all I would be thinking about checking out Fords. "
"ateixeira","January 2011"," ...like Ferdinand Piech and the Phaeton? Not NEARLY that big, let's be honest. Piech had world domination in mind.Now he's back and VW took over Porsche.

"ateixeira","January 2011"," The problem with any comparison ads is that they acknowledge the competitor is the benchmark.The best advertising for the Camry is having Ford use it as the yardstick.Look how much free press BMW gets for the M3.

What was the saying about poking a bear one too many times?Thing is, Toyota has the means necessary to seriously strike back, and strike back hard.If we step back and look at the pipeline and then we realize that we have no clue what the next generation of vehicles have in store, including a new Camry and Corolla which are #1 and #3 best selling cars as well as an onslaught of new Lexus models ready for a new generation in the coming years, Toyota could be poised to recover quite easily...

"
"fintail","January 2011"," It's not a bad show...not as polished as the original of course, but it has to have a tiny budget in comparison, and is still brand new. The early days of TGUK were less than awesome as well.I don't even mind the hosts...a driver, a kind of pseudo-redneck wannabe hipster, and an east coast funnyman...they've had their moments. I don't know if any racially based cast changes would change anything. "
"explorerx4","January 2011"," I prefer to say a more diverse (population demographic) based cast.The last 2 episodes were pretty good, so I am looking forward to next season. "
"fintail","January 2011"," The truck episode and the ""American car"" themed one were pretty good, even if the latter was a take-off of a UK show. It can be good for a laugh, and really, there aren't a lot of car themed shows out there to begin with. Perfection isn't expected.I predict the demographics of the UK are pretty diverse too...gotta pick the best candidates above all. "
"ateixeira","January 2011"," It is definitely getting better, showing signs of promise. I think the dialogue is still too slow, there are lots of dead spots. It's as if they were waiting for a laugh track, except we don't hear laughing.Foust is fine, and it's good to have a driver among them.Ferrara is funny. He pulls off the East Coast psuedo-mafia humor.Rutledge struggles, IMHO. It's just not his best format. He's funny, but a lot of the long, awkward pauses seem to be with him smiling in front of the camera. The southern-boy schtick can work, but it needs polish. "
"michaellno","January 2011"," Re: TG US.I've read all the columns and comments from the masses stating how TG US will _______ (fill in with your vitriolic adjective here) when compared to the _________ (use positive adjective) TG in the UK.I have not made a comment on this before now because I wanted to watch all of season 1 before rendering an opinion.Hosts: Being season 1, I think that the interaction between the hosts got better as the season progressed. It's important to remember that TG UK has been around for, what, 8 or 9 years? Easy to have a comfortable relationship after that much time. I did see some improvement as the TG US season went on. I saw quite a difference in the interaction in the studio as opposed to when they were out on a challenge. I suspect this will get better with time, assuming there is a 2nd season. I think the biggest difference between the hosts is more linguistic .. can't imagine Tanner calling Rutledge a ""heartless [non-permissible content removed]"" or some such British phrase.Cinematography: About par with TG UK - this is one of the big reasons I like both shows so much. The camera angles and editing are first rate in both shows. I particularly liked the scenery in the Alaska episode.Stig: The US show doesn't use The Stig as well as the UK show. Would love to hear Adam say something like:""Some say his driving gloves are made from pork rinds ... and that kindergarten teachers run from him when he removes his helmet. All we know is .... he's called The Stig!"".Plus, they need to involve him in some of the challenges and/or races. Again, jury is out and we'll see what happens in season 2.Cars: Would have preferred that TG US focused more on US hardware than on Lambo's, Aston Martins and Ferraris. Yeah, they had the Raptor and the Viper, but that was about it for the formal road tests. Would have been much better for Tanner to have driven a Corvette to Vegas when racing Rutledge rather than the Ferrari California.Challenges: Not much difference between the shows in this respect. My wife, who has only watched part of an episode or two of both versions, commented that the ""Moonshiners Challenge"" reminded her of the TG UK episode where the boys flew to Miami, bought junkers for $1K or less, then drove them to New Orleans. No originality in that respect - again, there needs to be more Americana infused into what they do.Overall, I guess I'd give season 1 of TG US a B-. Certainly room to improve, but better than some of the c**p that ends up on TV. And, hey, it's better to have TG US than not, eh? "
"ateixeira","January 2011"," Nice review. I totally agree they could feature the Stig more.I am the US Stig, by the way.  "
"explorerx4","January 2011"," Good post. I would give the show a C+.Sometimes, it does seem like a car commercial or infomercial.The episodes are very uneven.I do like the celebrity drive segments, because they actually care about how they did their lap compared to the other celebrities.Personally, I think the 'Stig' is Paul Tracy.

One big thing to remember is that TG UK is publicly funded, whilst TG US is driven by commercial revenue, so the boys in the UK can say pretty much whatever they want. MB does some serious advertising on TG US, so one wonders what would happen to the ad revenue if the TG US hosts were to trash an MB in a review.Big Star / Small Car: I'm OK with the SX4 being the car (again, would have been better if it was from a US manufacturer), and I think that the pre-lap interviews were good. Nice that all three hosts were involved, and that they tried to match the personality of the host to that of the guest. This segment, too, should get better with time.Was completely shocked to learn that Michelle Rodriguez didn't even have a drivers license when she was cast for the first ""Fast 'n' Furious"" movie.

I don't think either the Fiesta or Cruze were available yet when filming was done last summer.With regards to an ""identity crisis"" - not sure what you mean by that? You mean, does it want to be its own show or simply mimic TG UK?As the season progressed, I think they started to get a feel for what they were trying to do. However, if there is a 2nd season, they need to focus on the following:1) More Stig!2) More American cars - tested, used in challenges and racesThe awkwardness of the hosts in the studio should ease up as they spend more time together.

Just because this one car met its demise in a public way, you want to castigate the whole show?There was another episode where each of the hosts had to pick a former GM model to be resurrected.

"fushigi","January 2011"," Still, the point is that ""Top Gear US"" is actually ""Top Gear"". I don't think they need to favor domestic brands at all times or even most of the time. Doing so would not only disrespect the rest of the world's automakers it would make the show come across as discriminatory v. just biased.They already have a rather heavy US-slant in the comparison segments; they don't need to carry that over into all aspects.And in a way it's a good thing to focus on less popular brands. It gives the brand exposure (I've little doubt the car was provided by the manufacturer) and should squash any notions about the show being a popularity contest.If anything, given the advertising support, I'm surprised they aren't driving a small Mercedes.

"fintail","February 2011"," Well, Tiger Woods pitched Buicks... "
"ateixeira","February 2011"," Yeah but the timing was right - the Enclave was a hit and appeals to the golfer demographic.I've seen all of Chrysler's updated cars, and the 200 is one of the weakest products in their whole lineup.

"fintail","February 2011"," Or the new 300 for that matter (don't know where it is made).The Tiger thing for me was funny in that someone of his wealth would never drive something like a Buick. "

"fezo","February 2011","  (You guys remember newspapers, right?) Yeah. We remember Detroit, too.... "
"lemko","February 2011"," ...I liked it, but the product for which it was advertising is inconsistent with the ad.

The Detroit ad would be more appropriate for the Dodge Charger or Challenger, but I believe those cars are from Canada. "
"ateixeira","February 2011"," It did get a lot of press, but I think that's because people love a comeback, and Chrysler needs one.And let's remember, that was a 120 second ad! $12 million bucks, folks!

Also looks like a Saturn Astra.Thing is, doesn't Toyota offer more AWD options that Dodge does? Not 4WD, mind you, but AWD.

"anythngbutgm","February 2011"," That ""virtual test drive"" one is a clear dig at Mitsubushi who launched an interactive website for their new Outlander Sport. Ironically, Chrysler and Mitsu had a pretty good partnership going through the 90's and 2000's with engines being supplied (Base model 2.7l 6's) for the 300 and Charger!!!Other than that, everytime the commercial comes on, I make sure to nudge the volume up a couple of ticks just to rumble the house with that intoxicating engine note that sings throughout the advertisement Great ad. "
"lemko","February 2011"," ...the commercial with the man wearing a chest carrier with a baby in it looking at a VW Jetta? I don't know what kind of guy would wear such a device except for one who is absolutely terrified of his wife and whose manhood is kept in a jar by the same woman. It certainly doesn't inspire me to buy a Jetta if it's the preferred conveyance of emasculated men like the one in the commercial. "
"fintail","February 2011"," Well, a Jetta isn't exactly the most masculine vehicle on the road, I will say that much. "
"ateixeira","February 2011"," Funny and ironic. Nice ads, they got my attention, that's for sure.And what was Mitsubishi thinking, by the way? I heard about the virtual test drive and laughed.The 2nd ad seems to target Toyota/Lexus, and it's also effective.Kudos to the ad guys. They definitely will appeal to the target demographic (I jokingly refer to them as the Neanderthal Male). "
"fushigi","February 2011"," Well, during the online test drive, available slots filled up every day the offer was on, including the couple of added days. So from a PR perspective it was quite successful. And so far Mitsu seems pleased with the initial sales of the Outlander Sport (they're specifically going to move OS production to the US) so it must have gotten the desired sales traffic follow-through as well. "
"ateixeira","February 2011"," Yeah, I heard they would phase out the Galant and build the Sport there instead, maybe other small cars too? I wonder if they'll sell enough volume for a whole plant. Probably, if they build for export as well.A neighbor bought a black one, mom in her 40s. "
"fushigi","February 2011"," The manager of the local pizza/pasta joint bought one in blue to replace her Endeavor. At the Chicago Auto Show, my wife was shopping for a compact sedan to replace her '01 Elantra. We won't buy for at least 6 months, but most of the compact sedans she just didn't care for. That included the Cruze & new Elantra - both of which were previously on her short list. The Kizashi, Impreza, Sentra, Mazda 3, and pretty much every other make of compact sedan (or small mid-sizer) had some things she didn't care for. Ditto the sub-compacts though those mostly because they feel cramped.Surprisingly, the Outlander Sport & Tucson were her favorites. Doubly surprising on the Tucson since she panned it at last year's show. "
"ateixeira","February 2011"," I just test drove a Kia Sportage (its twin) with my brother and we both liked it more than expected.The kicker - price was $19.2k!Undeniable value. "
"fintail","March 2011"," Watched TV for 45 mins tonight, saw the Lexus CT commercial 3 times. We get it - you have a new car that is marginally less boring than the rest of the lineup. I don't know if the economy is ready yet to make a Prius related vehicle that can get near 40K to be a mass market item. "
"ateixeira","March 2011"," The sudden 33 cent surge in gas prices won't hurt in terms of timing.They sure as heck got lucky. "
"lemko","March 2011"," ...those who panic and buy, say a Corolla, to replace a huge SUV because of escalating fuel prices soon regret it. They've become accustomed to the comfort and capabilities of a larger vehicle and aren't going to be happy with a much smaller one. Worse yet, one trades in a paid-off vehicle and now has a car payment on top of the higher fuel costs. Even worse if one trades a vehicle still being financed and find he's upside-down. "
"ateixeira","March 2011"," Agreed, the vehicle still has to meet your needs. A Highlander hybrid would be a more reasonable step-down, or at least an Equinox or something. "
"fintail","March 2011"," Indeed, they hit the jackpot. Co-worker just bought a loaded Prius. She claims she got it for 4K under sticker, but the dealer told her they were going to increase prices soon. Amusing.The Mountain Dew CT was nowhere to be seen last time I drove by the local dealer, maybe it sold? I'm actually marginally curious about that car, as in my eyes it is developed to give the brand more exposure in Europe. "
"ateixeira","March 2011"," I dunno, Europe is in love with diesels. This won't do nearly as well there. "
"fintail","March 2011"," They have only one diesel model for Europe, and few buy it either.Now if the CT was a diesel hybrid using the engine from their diesel IS, I'd be looking seriously at it. "
"ateixeira","March 2011"," I've wondered about the same thing.Diesels aren't too happy starting and stopping constantly, but the potential fuel savings are great. Diesels are ideal on the highway, while hybrids do better in the city (and highway gains are negligable). Combine both, voila, best of both worlds. "
"fintail","March 2011"," I think there must be some electrical incompatibility with diesels and hybrids - as none seem to be on the market anywhere. Shame - you'd get 60mpg out of one easy, I bet.Either way, for whatever reason, the CT might be the Lexus I dislike least. "
"ateixeira","March 2011"," I think they are cost-prohibitive.Each on its own adds a couple of grand (at least) in cost. Together you're talking about $5-6 grand more.Hard to make that up, though range would be incredible.CT to me is a bit odd looking, I guess it has character, I'll give 'em that.I understand the appeal of hybrids but most do not appeal to me. I'd rather have an IS-F or even an IS350 AWD. "
"lemko","March 2011"," Interesting. I'd like to see somebody put together a diesel hybrid just to see what the range/MPG would be. I recall VW Rabbit Diesels being rated at 50 MPG in 1980. "
"roadburner","March 2011"," Agreed, the vehicle still has to meet your needs.People panic and just HAVE to buy a fuel efficient car- and usually the math doesn't support their frantic decision. For example, I saw a nice 2010 Mini Cooper equipped just the way I'd want one(except that it had a big hole in the roof :mad: ). I could probably trade my MS3 and wind up paying @$10000 OTD. The Mini averages 39 mpg while my Mazda returns 23.5 mpg. Driving 16000 miles annually with gas at $4.00 per gallon I would save $95 per month. However, assuming I paid cash for the MCS I would have to drive the car for almost nine years before I broke even(10000/95= 105.26 months, or 8.77 years. "

"fintail","March 2011"," Do diesels really cost that much more, or is it just a markup a few makers use? They seem to have marginal if any price differentials in Europe.If gas was $10/gallon, I wouldn't want those gassers for daily use. IS-F is the one I'd want too, but maybe not in the future, and not at its MSRP.Co-worker who bought a Prius traded in a several year old MDX that she broke even on...claims payment stayed the same, but she says she'll be saving a couple hundred a month at least in gas. Maybe a lot of these soft road poser SUVs aren't really needed after all. "
"stever","March 2011"," Driving 16000 miles annually with gas at $4.00 per gallon I would save $95 per month.On the other hand, Saudi Arabia could pull a Libya and the price of oil could go to $200 a barrel and gas could double to $8 a gallon. All of a sudden your payback is 4.5 years.Sounds like the makings for a good car commercial - some AK47s, exploding oil wells, and a Prius cruising along in the background.  "
"lemko","March 2011"," Actually, it would be the chatter of AK-47s, exploding oil wells, and then...the cheerful ring of a bicycle bell as a man pedals by on a Schwinn in that scenario. "
"ateixeira","March 2011"," It's harder to meet CARB emissions, so diesels that meet US standards cost more.Lots of car makers have engines in Europe that they can't sell here without a particulate filter, for example Subaru.A poor man's MDX option would be a Kia Sorento 4 cylinder. You can even get a manual transmission IIRC. No 3rd row with the 4 banger, but I doubt the MDX owner used it anyway.I tend to look for fuel efficiency, but the most efficient vehicles that meets my needs. Not a miser that doesn't. "
"stever","March 2011"," It's harder to meet CARB emissions, so diesels that meet US standards cost more.And yet the car companies have managed with gasoline CARB requirements, plus removing lead from gas, plus the CAFE standards, and maybe E15 next.Maybe people in the US just don't want them. :shades: What Would It Take for YOU to buy a diesel car? "
"fintail","March 2011"," Do the emissions add-ons really cost those thousands per vehicle?No doubt the average MDX owner doesn't use the seating or AWD. The newbie Prius owner I know seems happy so far. I wonder when those will be in commercials again. "
"ateixeira","March 2011"," No, I meant cumulative. Diesel blocks are beefier and generally cost more. Plus, remember these are turbocharged and intercooled. Then add to the extra cost of the particulate filters. Figure a total premium of a couple of grand.Hybrids need pricey batteries, so a couple more grand.Total maybe $4-5k over a conventional gas engine. Just a guesstimate.That's not much on a luxury car, maybe 10% or so, but for a compact you're adding a significant % to the purchase price. "
"anythngbutgm","March 2011"," Doubt Toyota wil be spending the money on advertising the Prius. With 4 dollar gas coming, the things will sell themselves... :shades: "
"fintail","March 2011"," It seems ads for them died off when gas was cheap...Toyota might need to remind people they exist, as if driving behind one merging onto a highway isn't enough :shades: "
"fintail","March 2011"," Well, to be fair, I was originally thinking of a diesel hybrid CT...it costs enough as to where a few grand won't kill it. Too bad the Germans haven't made that, all of their hybrids are gas too. Maybe there's just a catch somewhere that makes it not work. "

"fintail","May 2011"," I think when people think FWD Caddy they think 1985 DeVille or 1986 Eldo etc...the image was really damaged.Caddy would be well advised to offer AWD in everything if not making it standard. "
"lemko","May 2011"," Cadillac only has one FWD model left and it's the DTS. I'm pretty sure FWD will be gone when it's replaced by the XTS sometime in the near future.Oh, believe me, I was horrified at the shrunken 1985 FWD DeVilles and Fleetwoods and the even worse FWD 1986 Eldos and Sevilles. I was a junior in college when they debuted and was afraid there would be nothing to look forward to buying after I graduated. Fortunately, they kept the RWD Brougham around a bit longer. "
"fintail","May 2011"," We are lucky that cars didn't evolve into the dystopian brave new world that many assumed would be the future 30 years ago. Score one for technology.Those Eldos and Sevilles seemed especially crappy...they are a rare sight anymore too, which says a lot. "
"ateixeira","May 2011"," The take rate on AWD options for luxury cars is surprisingly high, and trending upward. Just read an article about that, and they mentioned the CTS as an example. "
"fintail","May 2011"," If I was buying a new E or 5er, I would be tempted...it doesn't cost a huge premium anymore either. "
"xrunner2","May 2011"," Caddy would be well advised to offer AWD in everything if not making it standard. Nah. When you consider all the seniors and golden seniors driving Caddies in FL, AZ, CA, what possible use would be AWD? These folks, who only drive maybe a few times a week only need RWD. I see some of these seniors in my area with padded top Caddies. Must be a lucrative aftermarket for somebody putting on these tops. Never did understand the WHY of padded tops. "
"xrunner2","May 2011"," If Jay Leno did an extended interview on the streets in LA about FWD, RWD, AWD of people of all ages, they would not even know what he was talking about. Most people don't know jack about it and only look at other attributes when picking a car. "

Warm area people flock to obese SUVs.I don't like in a snowy area either, but lots of AWD highline cars here.Padded tops - chic among the toupee set in the 70s, some people never move on from what they see as a golden age. You see it in the way some people maintain their facial hair, hairstyles, and clothing, too. "
"xrunner2","May 2011"," Our president should come out against awd vehicles in areas such as FL, AZ south, CA, and similar climate areas, etc. These cars waste fuel by carrying extra weight, friction of moving parts and thus poorer gas mileage. Unless you are driving a lot on snow, ice for a good part of year or drive on dirt or gravel roads, awd is stupid. "
"fushigi","May 2011"," The ""waste fuel"" argument doesn't hold as much water as it used to. Modern AWD/4WD systems stay FWD-biased and shift power to the rear wheels when needed (or told to); as such they impose minimal penalties. Examples: Honda CR-V 4 cyl 2WD: 21/28/24 city/highway/combined; AWD: 21/27/23. So just 1 MPG loss in non-city driving. Mitsubishi Outlander V6 2WD: 19/25; AWD: 18/24. Again, just a 1 MPG loss. Explorer V6 FWD: 17/25/20; 4WD: 17/23/19 so a loss of 2 highway but just 1 overall.So, worst case is still under a 10% fuel economy penalty but 2 of 3 are under 5%. You driving style will have a greater impact on fuel economy than AWD's overhead. "
"ateixeira","May 2011"," on the streets in LA Also keep in mind that location - very, very mild climate.Ask someone in Vermont and he might not know what FWD is at all, because they often would not even consider a vehicle without 4/AWD. "

Whoop-de-doo.So the Audi ad is pure nonsense.And each Lexus franchise sold 76 cars despite the shortage, vs. just 36 for Audi.Another important factor to remember - Lexus dropped incentives for that month, and they may bring them back.So basically dealers are selling every Lexus they can get their hands on right now, even without discounts. "
"fintail","May 2011"," Lexus has pretty much always outsold Audi in this market (and pretty much none other outside of this continent) since the dawn of time, hasn't it?

Seems to be plenty hanging around the dealer near me. "
"ateixeira","May 2011"," Those are nationwide numbers. Of course we'll see regional variances.Overall Lexus dealers have about half as many cars as they'd probably like to have.

"ateixeira","May 2011"," Sagging sales? They were #1 in 2010 even with all the SUA baloney, even when you count Sprinter sales in with M-B.Recent sales drops have been due to the tsunami, lack of supply, and elimination of incentives due to the lack of supply.Face it, you don't like the facts you saw in that chart, so now you are spinning them. And yes, I'm sure M-B sold more than Lexus worldwide when you count all the taxis in the middle east. :P "
"fintail","May 2011"," A sales drop due to ""lack of supply"" implies there are cars that people can't buy, but want to. What are these cars, and what are customers buying to make up for it? Other than the CT, I can't imagine any Lexus model having any kind of wait at all. Aging, boring, invisible lineup, while the competition becomes more dynamic and has sales and market share gains to back it up.When Lexus Camrys are counted, I have no problem counting Sprinters...NA is the only market where Lexus is even a real player. "
"ateixeira","May 2011"," The CT is the only new model. In a way the timing could have been much worse, if the tsunami had come during the upcoming GS/IS launches. Those would do more volume and have a bigger effect.Lexus dropped incentives sharply, but the numbers don't lie, a 32 days' supply is not exactly stagnant. Look at M-B....Audi has no share at all before, so there was nowhere to go but up.Edit: to add, more importantly, that the Audi ad actually shows a guy climbing out of a BMW X3. Well, the new X3 is here, and more in demand than any Audi model.The irony.... "
"tmart","May 2011"," Since ""NA is the only market where Lexus is even a real player"", and I live in NA, I don't really care about the ""other markets"" around the world. We know you don't like Lexus, but why continue to bash them? There ARE folks who prefer a luxury cruiser over a sports/sporty one. My wife's ES300 still has more than enough power to get me in trouble as does my C70. They both provide the function for which they were bought. In my opinion, and my opinion only, I wouldn't have a MB if one were given to me. It would go straight to Carmax for their offer. But that's just me. I'm aware many folks like MB, but that's their choice, not mine. And I wouldn't bash their choice. "

Save for the CT, if I want virtually any new Lexus, I can go take my pick right now, no line, no gouging, they'll be happy to take my money and get one off the lot.

They're hardly qualified to make the judgements they make. "
"fintail","May 2011"," Well, if there were valid shortages, I think Toyota would be making a big deal of it in the media.

Any supply issues are not very significant. "

"fintail","May 2011"," I like the ""Citadel"" badge...I saw one of these, and the first thing that came to mind as I read it was ""Citroen"". Odd name to put on a car, people will pronounce it wrong too. But the previous Durango was such a bloated heavy sled that any small sins can be forgiven. "

"fintail","May 2011"," That's a funny case though, someone ordering a sport trim level on a base car - probably with a weird color combo and special options too. Probably always a special order.Regarding Nissan/Infiniti, all seems like a good way to explain away lost sales due to an aging model lineup to me. I am not sure how much cross shopping really goes on there anyway, people who really want a Lexus don't seem to like other cars. "
"ateixeira","May 2011"," You can nit-pick about one case but the complaints are widespread. Prices are up, selection is down. Face it.You complain about an aged lineup, true, but you yourself excluded their only new model from this discussion (CT200h).Supply of old models is short, supply of new models is non-existent. That one guy ran out and bought an Enclave.You are so blindly biased, it's ridiculous. "
"fintail","May 2011"," I am not the one who picked that one case as an example.What sales volume was the CT ever expected to have anyway? Never meant to be the leader, just a new model after the HS failed so loudly. And I have mentioned the CT in this case numerous times, and you know it.Supply of old models is shorter, but there are no empty lots. Dealers can play hardball all they want, some will win at it, some won't. I see nothing showing the SINGLE new model was going to be a significant part of sales to begin with.Lexus has a boring aging lineup that primarily appeals to people who don't really care much for cars or driving or being alive. The competition has capitalized on this. Deal with it. "
"ateixeira","May 2011"," HS outsells the MKZ hybrid, it's closest competitor, 2 to 1. So the Lincoln is twice the failure...LOL.And what about the Germans? They are now launching their own hybrids left and right, after swearing up and down diesels were sufficient. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em? They are all following Lexus. Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. No one has truly figured out how to sell a luxury hybrid. Let's see if the CT can break that pattern. Or anything else for that matter.Of course there are no empty lots, but the selection is dwindling and of course that affects sales. You can't deny this is a clear case of supply and demand.That last sentence sums up your biases nicely.Never mind the LF-A, or the IS-F that just HUMILIATED Mercedes' AMG models on the Lightning Lap. I bet you'd still buy the slower car.Let's go ahead and stereotype all Lexus buyers while we're at it. Just goes to show how few of them you know.You asked for examples and I offered you a dozen or so (edit: 15 examples actually). Every one of those examples directly contradicts what you've been saying. "
"fintail","May 2011"," Lincoln hasn't succeeded at much lately. Not the best example. But if something like Nissan is ""stealing"" sales...not a good sign. Also wonder how many HS were given away in loss leading leases several months ago. It failed, deal with it.Diesels have been sufficient everywhere but here. Maybe a reason why Lexus is so invisible in the rest of the developed, or even more developed, world. Where is someone imitating Lexus, which models are copies?A fun debate could be had about how much of a luxury car a 30K hatchback CT really is...LF-A - grossly overpriced, not a regular production car, irrelevant. IS-F, beat who, by what, when? CTS-V has beat some too, so what?I don't know every Lexus driver, but there are an awful lot of them in my area, and they don't seem to be very enthusiastic. I go to a MB club show every year here, haven't seen any local Lexus clubs.I didn't see any examples of actual shortages, sorry. Just dealers playing games or someone whining because they couldn't get a sport trim package on a lowline model (typical poser rofl) in a weird color right off the lot.

"fintail","May 2011"," I don't know of anyone who considers an A-class to be in the same universe as near lux. Go to Europe, it's just an econobox, one that car renters revile as much as the PT Cruiser here.MB pioneered the use of diesel engines in large scale production, and in passenger cars. Diesel also came from German stock and moved back to Germany as a teenager...No shortages. I can run down and get what I want, maybe not a LF-A or a lime green IS250 with sport trim and an AM radio, or a new RX for 20% under MSRP, but otherwise, no, and it doesn't explain away the gains being made by others. "
"ateixeira","May 2011"," People driving hours and hours = regional shortages.Let's agree to disagree.Audi is flush with new product and that's why they have gains. This is a normal part of the life cycle of automobiles, and comes as no surprise. Will they sustain that growth as those products age? We shall see. "
"fintail","May 2011"," Or people with unreasonable expectations DoneAudi has been on the upswing since the revised A6 13 years ago. I think they have a few more life cycles of steam left in them. Longterm reliability of 2005+ models will determine a bit too. "
"ateixeira","May 2011"," I'd go even further back - it was the 1997 A4 that started turning things around for Audi, 15 years or so ago.They are flush with new product right now...the A4 is only a couple of years old, the A6 is new, the A7 is new, the Q7 isn't brand new but it's fresher than competitors, the Q5 is fresh...All their high volume products are new.Lexus is the opposite. Only the RX is fresh, and it's doing fine. The ES is ancient, 2007 I think it came out IIRC. The GS and IS are even older - 2006? The other new-ish Lexus is the GX and it's sales are also up, so it's doing OK.I'm not sure what people expected from the HS, it's the best selling hybrid or diesel in its price range or higher.This is a normal part of any car's life cycle. Lexus will have a new GS, a new IS, and probably a new ES within a year or so. The ES in particular is an important volume model for them.You poke fun at Lexus, and that's OK, but you're inconsistent - in one breath you say Lexus owners don't consider anything else, in the next you say Audi is stealing sales away from Lexus.You contradict yourself directly in your eagerness to insult Lexus in any way you can. That's not OK. "
"fintail","May 2011"," The B5 A4 came to NA for 1996, I think. Either way, it did hint at upcoming design prowess, but some of the older ones are very troublesome and I don't know if the car had much of an image. But the C5 A6 was seen as a design revelation when it first showed up, and got people to look. It was ahead of its time.IS and GS are indeed that old...I can't imagine why anyone would buy a new GS. LS is also getting up there. HS is impossible to compare as nothing competes with it - and the way they were laughably being given away in sweetheart leases not long ago speaks volumes. Hopefully for them the CT will make up for it.Lexus, like all highline makers, has a devoted fanbase - although in this case most are not really enthusiasts. It also has a lot of those who just like to be seen. These are the ones who jump ship. I never said every Lexus owner was devoted...hell, I'd wager a significant amount of money the majority don't know the brand is Toyota...If something isn't OK to you, you are free to ignore it :P I haven't seen anything from Lexus that would make a person want to defend it, myself. I think the inability of the brand to succeed in other markets is telling. Even their commercials are pretentious or lame. "
"ateixeira","May 2011"," That A4 started the styling revolution at Audi...it was a real looker. The design aged well, too.LS is also, what, 6 years or so in to its life cycle?Life cycles of 6-8 years are perfectly normal in the luxury segment, I don't have to tell you that. You just seeemed to imply that Lexus took longer than most to refresh them - that's not true.It just so happens that right now Lexus has several models towards the end of that cycle. "

But with so many people supposedly (huge grain of salt there) viewing IS forums, one would think they'd be more popular.A base IS 250 is no more exciting than an ES to me, and really, the same ability of driver around here seems to go for it, just younger. No more exciting than the blandest leased C300 or 328i either. The F is seen on the road as often as legit supercars, and the LFA with its bloated price, weird styling, and bizarre purchase scheme, is almost just a dream.But carry on with the defensive devils advocate for the most boring brand in the world, one that is desperately trying to shed that image that even it knows exists, it's a free world :P "

"anythngbutgm","May 2011"," By the way, I don't intend to play devils advocate for Lexus, I'm just not sure they are as irrelevant to the enthusiasts world as you would like to believe that's all. Me, I still prefer German (or Infiniti) if I want a performance car from a true performance brand. I won't argue that Lexus survives on a ton of RX and ES sales, but with the bank account that Toyota has to throw at the brand, and the strides they are making with the ""F"" line and LFA models I wouldn't count them out for building some serious street cred against the Germans down the road. Who knows, maybe fuel efficiency will drive the next round of performance vehicles? Hybrid power being tapped to build the next lineup of AMG fighters rather than big V8's and V12's? Nobody leads in hybrid tech more than Toyota does, so if gas does get to 6 - 7 bucks, or more, then Toyota already has a jumpstart on everybody in experience, lessons learned, advancements, etc.But, I'll bow out of this discussion and just continue as a reader.

NAIAS 2006 and 2007, the Legacy/Outback intro at Vegas Speedway (fun to drive a GT on the oval), and the Tribeca intro in PA (got a Murano up on 2 wheels, scary).

He starts making driving noises like a kid would and moving like he's driving spiritedly.

"fintail","June 2011"," Sadly still an eyesore compared to what it replaced.Funny how they had to normalize the design though. "
"ateixeira","June 2011"," That's common, though. Look at, say, the BMW 7. Bangled up, then the re-do comes out and softens the lines significantly.It's like an evolutionary apology. "
"fintail","June 2011"," Well, the F01 7er is a completely new animal after something like 8 years of the Bangled E65/66 which received only a minor update in its lifespan. The facelifted TL came much sooner after heavy derision - more akin to the Subaru Tribeca with the bullnose Saab or Edsel front end that was quickly redone, and still sells at least a dozen a year. "
"ateixeira","June 2011"," The facelifted TL came much soonerDid it? Seemed like it took forever.All I've heard is people referring to ""pre-beak Acuras"" over and over again.Let's see, usually a life cycle is 5 years, and a mid-model make-over is done for the 4th year.2009, 2010, 2011 had the big beak.2012 gets the light beak.I dunno, seems like it came on schedule.I guess for me it seemed like longer because they sell a LOT of Acuras around here.Ninja Edit: Tribeca was redone for its 3rd year, so indeed that was pushed forward a year from the normal mid cycle refresh. "
"fintail","June 2011"," You can't say you don't think the TL wasn't redone to tone down the garbagey ""styling"" a bit. Notice the previous nice looking version didn't get much of any updates at all in its lifespan. It was done right. The fact that aftermarket parts exist to mask the beak says a lot.Tribeca was redone for the same reason, it was just too weird and hard on the eyes. "
"ateixeira","June 2011"," It certainly was toned down - for sure.I'm just saying the process wasn't rushed. It was re-done on the normal schedule for a 5-year life cycle, with a refresh for the 4th year, as usual.In other words, Acura was stubborn. Perhaps they should have rushed the refresh? "
"fintail","June 2011"," I think they got a huge ego boost from the success and positive press of the previous model, and believed they could do no wrong - did not want to admit a mistake was made even though sales undoubtedly suffered. A few overpaid execs probably had to be convinced by multiple sources to get the ball rolling.They didn't have a refresh at all on the previous TL generations either, so I don't know if I would call it normal. I see it as a reaction, not evolution. "
"ateixeira","June 2011"," Yeah, didn't they just add a Type S model or something?Seems like they just kept selling more of the same, since the formula worked.To be honest I didn't pay much attention because back then they didn't even offer AWD. "

"ateixeira","June 2011"," I have a love/hate relationship with Mazda.I also test drove the CX9. In the driver's seat, your right knee rubs up against some (unnecessary) center console trim. I could not get comfortable. I was bummed because the price was far better than the Lambdas, at least until the $7k incentive arrived.Funny thing is my MX-5 has an annoying protrusion on my left knee, fixed for 2009, but then they added that silly grin face. Ugh.I modified the dead pedal a bit to get around it. Easy enough, but Mazda needs to spend more time actually sitting in the cars during the design stage.Zoom Zoom. "
"robr2","June 2011"," We're going with the Explorer. Just have to set aside an afternoon to go order it.What I disliked about the Acadia was that when my wife adjusted the seat so she could reach the pedals, her knees were about an inch away fromm the lower dash - didn't seem safe to me. Also, it's pricey.I didn't care for the interior of the CX-9. It seemed dated especially compared with the Explorer. I'm not a fan of gated automatics and the switchgear felt low rent to me. Lastly the grin annoys me. "
"ateixeira","June 2011"," You don't want to wait for the EcoBoost model? Just curious. "
"robr2","June 2011"," No - we want the AWD and the Ecoboost will only be available with FWD.Here in New England the AWD is worth it - we ski so for that reason alone my wife wants it. We've done fine with just FWD in the past with snow tires but wife wants the AWD. Who am I to argue?? "

Most are foam filled and are meant to absorb an impact just once. "

They could have instead had an ""enthusiast"" talking about instant torque and it being the only RWD EV.The commercial is for the domestic audience. Honda and other manufacturers orient their US ads around us so I don't why Mitsu shouldn't.The TV version is better, unlike the Soul ""dancing gamers"" commercials where the long version is much better than the short one.Normal is where their US plant is so both Mitsu & Normal have a vested interest in seeing each other succeed. And I very much like that it's not California or one of the other traditional ""early adopter"" states that get Leafs & Volts before the rest of the US.Personally I don't see why a city car won't work in rural settings. Those folks are just as likely to have secondary vehicles for distance runs, though I admit those vehicles will more often than not be less-efficient pickups.

The ad is structured in such a way that the unsuspecting viewer might believe it actually happened. Ridiculous.The other ones are equally bad - one where a Nissan pickup goes up a sand dune that a purpose-built vehicle could not, and a Leaf ad that shows a driver unplugging it from a (non-existent) charging station/parking meter device. Perhaps Nissan is catering to the delusional.I have disliked Nissan's ads for several years now, with their overemphasis on computer effects, cars spinning into position from beneath the ""floor"" on the screen, etc., but really, these are just too much.

Heck, both of our cars still have the original batteries!My only complaint is the service dept. are not up to the standards set by the local Honda and Toyota dealers with the drive- thru bays on those cold rainy mornings or the thorough updates of our cars (Honda dealers used to give us in depth updates on current tire pressures, oil life, transmission fluid life, battery charge, etc...) but as juice mentioned, they do get the job done and so far I am expecting a Honda/Toyota like longevity out of each of them.I do appreciate the environmentalist messages that used to come across the airwaves and I don't mind the ""Subaru Love"" campaign either. They really do connect with us even if we are mid thirties ""D.I.N.K.'s"".  "
"ateixeira","November 2011"," That ad campaign has resonated well with Subaru buyers. I think the best one is the father/daughter where they show a 5 year old, then a 16 year old. Neat fact - they're actually related. The ad team felt the chemistry was so good they let them ad-lib, too.The ad with the Acadia Green Metallic Forester (""You never forget your first Subaru"") really hits home because I owned one in that color, and yes we have a current model Forester too.I think that sort of ad works better than, say, the Ford Fusion Hybrid gas station ads where someone jumps out and yells it has 10mpg city better than the Camry Hybrid which is no longer made.What horrible timing. First time I saw it, the new Camry was already in dealers.Do those idiots realize the Fusion gets 41/36 and the new Camry gets 43/39? Hello?

"fushigi","November 2011"," There's a minor consistency error in the 5YO/16YO commercial. When it finally cuts to the 16 year old, the color of the stripes in her shirt changes. For me that breaks the thought train we're supposed to have which is the father still envisioning his little girl as his teenage daughter is about to drive off. Otherwise it is a decent commercial. Doesn't shout at you and gives the message about trusting the brand in a way people can relate.That said, the commercial where the guy misplaces his sunglasses & they wind up in his sweatshirt's hood is one I could easily never watch again. It just makes him look dumb and doesn't advance the brand at all. "

To be fair, Subaru knows their customers - and indeed hockey is VERY common among Subaru Crew members here.They seemed to write this ""Reunion"" commercial for ME, about ME:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5UwvFbi5PE&NR=1I had a Forester in that color, took that blonde to prom in high school, but married the brunette. They had me at hello. :shades: "
"fushigi","November 2011"," The point is that he's looking in the car at his teenage daughter but in his mind's eye he's still seeing her as the 5 year old. So no, she's not allowed to change shirts. Different outfits would be OK if the production was done differently, like if it was a memory of different times when she playfully sat behind the wheel pretending to drive or other times in/around the car when she was younger.Continuity gaps don't often bother me but for some reason this one does. Probably because the commercial itself is otherwise very good. "
"fushigi","November 2011"," Hockey Mom is OK; people will easily substitute baseball, football, soccer, etc. And it's friendly for airing in Canada as well as the US. The big problem I see is that it does nothing to distinguish the car's features from any other wagon/SUV/minivan on the road.Reunion I just don't get. Both the man & woman have moved on in their lives are are now with others. In that respect it implies while you might start with a Subaru & keep fond memories of it, when you grow up you'll move on. :confuse: "
"ateixeira","November 2011"," The hockey one is my least favorite.There was a minivan ad that executed the same idea much better. A dad takes over for mom for a day, and drive the kids around in a (I think?) Kia Sedona. By the end of the day he's beat and the mom says, ""THAT is what I do all day"". Much more clever, and they show the seating configurations throughout the commercial. Funnier and more effective.Reunion - you trade the old one for whatever reason but you still have fond memories, and the person you marry may not be so different (he got another Subaru).For what it's worth, this ad campaign drove (pardon the pun) Subaru to 2 consecutive records years. It would be 3 if they had enough Foresters to sell. Outback and Legacy both had record months in October, so the brand is red-hot, with only supply issues getting in the way.My brother had to order his Forester and wait a month or so. "
"fintail","November 2011"," But then one can ask, would these things not still be hot without the ads? "
"ateixeira","November 2011"," Tough to say, we can't really separate the two.Personally, I liked the 2005-2010 Legacy much better than the current model, but the new one is bigger and has sold extremely well.There were no significant improvements to the engines. Base models did get a CVT, but that hasn't helped other manufacturers much. I find the increase a big tough to explain, and I'm a Subaru guy, so the marketing has to be working. "
"fintail","November 2011"," I think the AWD is selling it too. Making it bigger didn't hurt either, even if car people frown upon it - most car drivers aren't car people.The ads don't impact me one way or the other, although I would like to see the two local Subie groups in it - those who put ski racks on their cars even though they don't ski, just to look sporty, and the boy racer crowd. They already have the 30-something guy on a 4 inch leash granted by wifey who keeps a perpetual 5 o'clock shadow as his one last grasp at freedom though :shades: "

Part-time ski/snowboard instructor in winter, summer job either at a kayak place or with a mountain climbing supply co.

The couple has 2 cars, Prius and Outback or Forester, and they switch at random :shades: Subaru has a very unique demographic anyway, that's for sure. "
"ateixeira","November 2011"," That's because only X5/RX/ML/RR can really afford to fill up that little shopping cart. I guess I'm having trouble seeing that connection - Subaru's achilles heel is gas mileage, and that's really the only reason you'd want a Prius.WRX and Prius are polar opposites, they just want to beat each other up on sight without provocation.At least they can agree on granola.  "
"fintail","November 2011"," I don't know how many buy a Prius for mileage over image. Subaru has a ""unique"" image too, and in this day of the hipster, that can be valuable.Boring Toyota and boring Subaru aren't so different though, esp if the former is AWD. "
"ateixeira","November 2011"," Au contraire mon frere...You always say Toyotas are bland, beige appliances. They understeer and have uber-numb steering, offering instead quiet isolation. Subarus have plenty of character. The boxer engines' growl alone would annoy an isolation-loving Toyota fanboy.Steering feel is generally excellent, since the front tires are not burdened with 100% of the power at any point in time (even AWD Toyotas are FWD first).Lift the throttle and you'll get the tail to wag, Ain't Gonna Happen in a Toyota. Consumer Reports complained about that, but a Subaru owner wouldn't mind.Until recently Subarus didn't even have window frames, to give you an idea how much NVH control was a priority.Toyota styling is an oxymoron. More like a lack of it. They're designed to blend in.Name one Subaru that blends in. Tribeca was WAY out there, too much so. The new Legacy is more Infiniti-ish with the stacked headlights, the Outback is bold, the Impreza is blocky with shoulders. The Forester is about as conservative as they get.So similar, except how they sound, feel, drive, steer, and look.The only thing they have in common is 4 wheels. "

IMO all of the current models are invisible in design, save for the weird Tribeca that pretty much nobody buys. Impreza - meh. Legacy - fat like a Camcord. Outback - maybe their Venza. Forester - shoebox.It's a Toyota for those who don't want a Toyota. Reliable, bigger now, boring looking now, enough hits for me anyway. "
"ateixeira","November 2011"," I liked that ad, too.People need to lighten up. "
"ateixeira","November 2011"," I disagree, Subaru has always appealed to niches, while Toyota is as mainstream as they come.If a test drive in a Toyota disappoints, that person would try a Honda next, then maybe a Nissan, then a Mazda.

"ateixeira","November 2011"," what's with the droopy grille bar?The plane-wing grille is being phased out.coarse enginesYou're comparing a beat up old $16k Impreza your relative owns to an six-figure AMG, not exactly a fair fight.Plus, Toyota engines are about as smooth as they come yet you'd never acknowledge that as one of their strengths. "
"fintail","November 2011"," It just got phased in, didn't it? Reactionary move I guess, like the toning down of the Edsel-like Tribeca or the Saab-nosed facelift Impreza of a few years ago.I was comparing a brand new 21K 2009 Impreza a co-worker bought to just about anything. Even when new, one can tell the out of tune lawnmower sensation is just around the corner. I don't know if that's really a good thing. Different is good, when the difference is good. "
"fintail","November 2011"," But do niches grow at the explosive expansion of Subaru sales? When does it stop being a niche and start being mainstream? IMHO, Subie has crossed that border. That might upset the die-hards who bought when it wasn't normalized, like how a hipster gets upset when his favorite band becomes known to others :shades: But really, Subaru is a lot less nichey than it used to be. In the Northeast and Northwest, it is every bit as normal and regularly seen as other brands.

"ateixeira","November 2011"," The Edsel Tribeca was 06-07, that was a long time ago. The current design has been in place since 08, and looks a bit conservative, but not ugly like you're saying.The evolution now is merely to phase out the wings that hold up the Pleiades logo. No drastic departure, and why should they? 2 years consecutive record sales for the brand.You're funny, how do you explain Subaru's success? You hate the designs, hate the marketing, and hate the engines. Perhaps the public does not agree with your opinion? I like the boxer sound, it's distinctive, has natural second order balance, no balance shafts (or added rotating mass) needed. To each his own. "
"ateixeira","November 2011"," When does it stop being a niche and start being mainstream?Let's go back to your Venza argument - competitors realized people were abandoning body-on-frame trucks in droves and Subaru was in the right in the hot spot - crossovers. They offered the high vantage point, cargo room, and traction of the trucks, with few of the trade-offs.Venza has not succeeded, though. It was planned before Toyota owned part of FHI, but it failed to steal away any Outback sales, in fact Outback sales grew significantly.So that crushes the theory that the buyers are the same - clearly they're not. Subaru buyers are loyal, and have not been buying Venzas and Crosstours. So much so that both of those competitors are bombing in an ugly way.Also, Nissan Rogue hasn't hurt Forester sales, they also hit record levels last year. RAV4 and CR-V existed before the Forester, but Subaru sales have grown steaily since 1995, before either of those were born, also.That might upset the die-hardsAs much as we asked for the WRX prior to 2002, we didn't really like the influx of, well, let's say less mature owners. You may feel the same way if a bunch of newbie C250 owners join your club who don't even know what a fintail is.The die-hards bought WRXs too, though. That's how they more than doubled sales. New customers = growing pains. And you can't say WRX stole Civic and Corolla sales, those buyers are also very different. Go to a NASIOC meeting and all you're hear about Honda is a lack of torque. Toyota does not come up in conversation at all.A lot of people defend the Porsche Cayenne, too. Small manufacturers can't survive in small niches only. Subaru had to branch out, but that doesn't make them Toyota.Speaking of upsetting the die-hards, and lot of them are upset that the BRZ will not even offer AWD. This is still controversial. I feel mixed - love the light RWD affordable funster idea, hate that it will draw in the demographic that watches Formula D. "
"robr2","November 2011"," Venza has not succeeded, though.Juice - I'll disagree here. The Venza sells 50K+ units a year. For a niche vehicle, it does just fine IMHO.It hasn't stolen sales from the Outback but I feel that isn't it's target. It's target is to keep exisiting Toyota buyers from defecting to Subaru. IMHO, the reason Toyota invested in Subaru was to get cheap, quick access to manufacturing capacity in the US. "
"fintail","November 2011"," The current Tribeca is just the old one sans weirdness. Doesn't matter though, both are very rare sights, probably never really needed in the lineup.Do good sales come from sound design or simply appealing to the masses? The masses don't care much about visual details unless it is *too* weird. Too bland is just fine - Corollas and Camrys don't sell because of timeless good looks, and neither do Subies. I already explained Subaru's success - running for the mainstream. A few new segments. Making vehicles both blander looking and larger. Some product differentiation with AWD. Not a beauty issue.""Hate"" is an awfully strong word, almost kind of a red herring :shades: "
"fintail","November 2011"," Or maybe the Venza (and especially the ugly Crosstour) is just a surplus product not needed when countless buyers are happy with their RAV4s and Highlanders. How many variants of basically the same segment can you make?Subaru is gaining buyers, so it must be gaining them from somewhere - mainstream brands. And mainstream buyers who will now go to Subie because Subie is now in fact mainstream - in size and looks especially.Where did WRX buyers come from then? Most of them probably weren't new to owning a car. Boy racers who came to the WRX in droves came from somewhere. Newbie C250 buyers will generally be leasers and/or people who don't become involved with any club - not loud people, not really apples to oranges. They might be trading from a similar base 328i or IS250 or something. And I agree about the (will it ever be seen? can we hype a platform more?) BRZ, no AWD, hard to see the point of existing under the brand. "

Give me the Kia between those two.On that note, Automobile named Schreyer man of the year.Back to Subaru, they have not gone too far mainsteam so as to scare off their traditional buyer base, though I wonder if a RWD car will cause that to start when the BRZ launches.

"ateixeira","November 2011"," Newbie C250 buyers will generally be leasers and/or people who don't become involved with any clubFunny side note ...Saw the guy who lives next door at a dinner party a mutual friend was hosting, he drives an 11 year old Volvo Cross Country and his wife a w211 E350.Well, we're talking about a renter who lives across the street, his car was vandalized twice. I comment that it's surprising to see a Benz broken in to not once but twice, given they are generally secure, and he says ""Yeah but that's not a real Benz"".I bust out laughing. It was amusing to see such a lack of acceptance for the Baby Benz. Perhaps Mercedes needs to bring the B-class here if only to remove the stigma of that model being entry level.And to come full circle and bring us back on topic, perhaps he did not like the new C hatchback's ad:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5fzQRO4V_w "
"fintail","November 2011"," I'd certainly take an Optima over a Sonata, really, I'd have no problem cross shopping it with all of the competition. Sonata is just too ugly or weird for me, Accord is big and bland, Camry might be better but don't know yet, Optima can offer a lot of bang for the buck.I guess there are relative levels of mainstream, but IMO Subaru really isn't an off in left field quirky choice anymore. It's another car. BRZ better look a lot different than it's Toyota twin or the Subaru nuts might not fall for it. "
"fintail","November 2011"," An E class not a ""real Benz""? Or does the renter drive a C? That's an odd opinion. I think the ""not a real Benz"" thing died off with the C hatch of 10 years ago. B-class would bring that back, A-class even more. I can't see why an IS250 or G25 etc would have any better rep.New C coupe isn't a hatch, it's a trunkback. Saw a C63 coupe at the dealer a couple weeks ago, I am not a fan as it isn't a hardtop, but it seems like a good amount of German muscle for the money, not as douchetastic as an M3, kind of a sleeper. Not my first choice, but if I got one for free...I am surprised that ad hasn't been complained about here, I mean, how many people actually hook up chains to their sedan and do burnouts to make it a coupe? Very unrealistic and immature :shades: "
"ateixeira","November 2011"," One quirk - Legacy is offered with a 6 speed manual, though. And not just the base engine, you can get a turbo manual as well. In fact, now that I think about it, all GTs are manuals. You want auto you get the H6 model.The mainstreamers have given up on manuals, for the most part. Especially with the upgrade engines. "
"ateixeira","November 2011"," C-class sedan, pardon the omission.C63 is $60 grand, ouch. Wait 5 years, let some Yuppie absorb 2/3rds of the depreciation, and get one for $20k.I can't see why an IS250 or G25 etc would have any better repThey don't. The Lexus has it even worse because that direct-injected engine has carbon build-up issues that the IS350 does not have. First thing people will recommend is to step up to the 350.The only thing the G25 did was allow Infiniti to bump the price on the G37.Oddly enough, both are 6 cylinder engines, even though a lot of people (even enthusiasts) don't realize that.

Less than that, for certain! :P "
"ateixeira","November 2011"," ""We"" means the Subaru Crew members here on Edmunds.Still going strong, 13 years now. "
"fintail","November 2011"," But if Mitsu is bouncing back and Subie continues to grow, where are these newbies coming from? Pontiac and Saab?At least in my region, I would compare Subaru with Mazda much easier than with Suzuki or Mitsu. I know multiple people who own Subies, none who own those others. "
"ateixeira","November 2011"," Newbies are coming from a variety of brands, Saab for sure, but also Ford, Volvo, and yes the mainstream brands, too.I don't think Subaru went mainstream. Mainstream came to them. AWD is in fashion. Subaru was already there, before it was trendy.To me, though, mainstream means FWD transverse I-4 engined sedans. Subaru is about as far from that as you can get. That doesn't mean some former mainstream owners won't switch over, but that's not the core, loyal Subaru buyer.Subaru's best selling models are the Forester and the Outback. Go back 40 years, and that's what they've been known for - wagons with 4 wheel traction and as you would say the characteristically ""coarse"" engine. That's still true today. The DNA is intact (hence the BRZ controversy).Compare to the other boxer engine makes VW and Porsche. The Beetle uses a mainstream layout now, transverse in-line 4 that is front mounted now. Totally mainstreamed.Porsche's 2 best selling models are a fat SUV and an ugly sedan. Where is the engine in the back? The air cooled boxer? They are so far from their DNA it's sad.Porsche sold out and uses VW platforms and engines. They sold their soul completely. Sure they still make cool cars, but those are not the best selling models (like Subaru).Subaru has remained indy and stuck to the simple formula of AWD wagons til this day. If they HAD sold out, you'd see Toyota's in-line engines in their models, or worse, Toyota's AWD systems, but you don't. To cooperate they had to build a whole new platform, and heck, Subaru engineered it and will build it at their plant!As mentioned above the only thing the partnership has meant so far is that Hoosiers are now building Camrys at SIA, and it's not even on the same line Subaru uses.Going forward I'm hoping Toyota can offer then Entune and not much else. I think they'd be wise to remain completely separated as they are now.I still think they should have figured out a way to make the BRZ AWD, though. "
"stever","November 2011"," I think Subaru got some of the older Volvo crowd, the teachers and ""practical"" folks that liked boxy and drove them forever (ignoring the rally aspect of the Subaru crowd).Volvo moved on to sporty so Subaru picked up some of that bunch. Like my sister who loved her old Volvo wagon with the sharp corners. She's in a Forester now. But it looks like Subaru is following the Volvo trend now with more ""stylish"" rides.I'm shopping for a tweed jacket with leather elbow patches for running around in my old Outback this winter. And a pipe.  "
"fushigi","November 2011"," Nah. Mainstream is defined by sales volume, not technology. Subaru is on track to sell over 250K cars in the US this year. That's slightly more than Mazda & MB and less than 20% behind BMW. Well behind, though, VW, Kia, and the big guys.The niche brands are generally going to be under 100K units a year. Mitsu, Suzuki, Volvo, Jaguar, etc. occupy that space. Mitsu's got the most volume in that group and will probably just crack 80K units for 2011.In fact, based on YTD sales through October there's no brand with sales that fall between Mitsu (70K though October) and Mazda (209K through October). "
"ateixeira","November 2011"," Don't forget the Birkenstocks in summer!  "
"fintail","November 2011"," AWD went mainstream (it even FINALLY exists in the Lexus LS now per an ad I have seen half a dozen times), but the rest of it, Subaru went the other way. Subies aren't a real niche anymore. The bloated and fairly bland styling, frameless doors went away, engines (while still rough) are quieter, there's been a 6cyl option for some time now and I'll wager the take rate has grown, toning down of controversial designs...looks like a run for the middle to me.Like in the recent ""daddy-daughter"" commercial, what is that thing she's sitting in, an Accord? :shades: Beetle is apples to oranges - old layout was always oddball and simply wouldn't be possible in such a car today. Same for Porsche - they need profits in this new age where the next quarter is as far as anyone looks, and their suits understand the wealth gap has grown in this globalized mess, along with the ideal of irresponsible conspicuous consumption by the beneficiaries - who love the Cayenne. Money talks and BS walks, same for a sportscar company or for a once-niche brand like Subaru.BRZ not being AWD is a sellout chapter for a brand that is less of a niche than ever before, and becomes more distant from the ""niche"" label and more embracing the mainstream with each new model. "
"ateixeira","November 2011"," No argument there, but again, did Subaru go mainstream, or did the mainstream shift towards Subaru?They're still building boxer powered AWD wagons, just like 40 years ago.Mitsu is at a turning point, gotta see if the iMiev catches on. It's tough to get volume in the EV segment, but the $7500 incentive represents the biggest discount in terms of %. If states help, and more work places offer free EV charging stations (my garage has them now), it could prove popular, but can they build very many?My question is, what's their identity?It's just that it's hard to imagine the EVO and iMiev in a show room right next to each other, without even a hybrid to bridge the gap. Can't really sell a green image convincingly.I guess they could go for a ""tech"" image, but they would need a Sync/Entune type system, and maybe make it standard.Aren't they partners with Peugeot and Citroen now?What about a C6 to fill the Galant's slot?They need fresh product. The partnership with Chrysler sucked the life out of them. "

"fushigi","November 2011"," AWD is mainstream, and you can probably thank the rise of the CUV for that. As you know, it's available on bread-n-butter vehicles like the Sienna and Fusion so it's somewhat difficult to see it as a continued differentiator.To be honest, few people care if Subaru's engine is a boxer or an I4 just like few care if BMW uses an I6 vs. a V6. They just want an engine that starts reliably and preferably has enough power to get them to CostCo and back.Subaru became mainstream. Perhaps it was due to some of Subaru's differentiating tech becoming mainstream, but I'd argue it's where Subaru wanted to go. Their commercials show it; they don't play up features specific to Subaru, they don't make as much fuss as they used to over AWD, they don't even go after an appearance of ruggedness.As to Mitsu's identity, I think you're on the right track with them going for a tech image. An EV contributes to that and Mitsu has a long history of offering more than the average number of gismos. Evo & i coexisting? The Corvette & Cruze Eco coexist on Chevy lots & the F-350 Super Duty & the Fusion Hybrid on Ford lots so what's the big deal?And hybrids are coming. How about a midsize plug-in hybrid CUV? 30 mile EV range then normal hybrid mode? Effective 141 MPG? Even if it only gets half that in the production unit it'd still be by far the most economical to drive CUV.The i will be the least expensive mass-market EV in the US. Something like $6 or 7 grand cheaper than the Leaf. Unique looks, which will definitely be a love-it-or-hate-it thing but it will grab attention. It's RWD which is also unique in the US EV world.Mitsu has FUSE ( http://www.mitsubishifuse.com ) for their hands-free system. It's a little basic right now but can always be expanded.Peugeot & Citroen have rebadged the Outlander. From what I read they're also going to sell the i and there may be other model sharing, but the talks back in 2009 about the companies buying into each other fell through in early 2010.They do need a ""new Galant"". They will remain niche unless they can offer a midsize sedan that's segment-competitive (which the old Galant was not). I've been saying they should rebadge the Kizashi but maybe they have something else up their sleeve like a hybrid-only platform. "
"fintail","November 2011"," And virtually all of them have that great tech. Peanuts to buy, not to maintain, and it'll only fool the unwashed if someone is trying to look rich for cheap. Might sound nice and have beautiful leather, but doesn't float my boat. "

I like that design, just ditch the clear lights everywhere, it looks like a black & white photo.My wife had a Mirage, and I did look at a Galant VR-4 AWD, too.

"andre1969","November 2011"," I'm more after the SUV crowd, the ES is a fairly harmless oldster mobile Lexus SUVs actually seem pretty rare around these parts. I'll usually see the aging, sagging, former trophy wives trolling around in SC430's, while used LS400 and 430 sedans seem to be the latest fad for the poseur crowd to park out in front of their section 8 housing.I don't see very many of the newer LS460's around. Most common Lexus seems to be the ES350, which seems harmless enough that I can't make any derogatory generalizations about. Mainly purchased by well-off, middle-aged to older people who want a nice, upscale, comfy car that doesn't draw too much attention to itself.There's a woman at work who drives a black GS hybrid. She's pretty high up the income ladder though, so it's not like she's stretching to afford it. At one time, she had some low-production BMW roadster, like a Z-8 or something like that? I heard it got lost in a divorce, though.I kinda like the older ES300 models. I thought they were really attractive, with their rakish lines, low roof, and frameless door windows that gave it a faux hardtop look. I thought they messed it up with the ES330 though, which just looked fat, and had those peeled-back headlights. "
"fintail","November 2011"," GS hybrid is a rare bird, if one must have a GS that might be the one to take just for the oddity. A BMW Z8 is even less common, those things are still worth 100K, have barely depreciated. I agree about the frameless door window ES - they did a better job at differentiating themselves from the Camry than later models, and the stretched out headlights of the 02+ model aren't exactly pretty. Just like the Faberge egg RX and the pretentious other models, which are big in these parts.I have known two younger people with used LS - both got them as parental hand me downs, one a nearly 200K mile 02 model that's in amazing condition.

"roadburner","November 2011"," Overall, the car market today is more about marketing wants than about capability/needs. 90% of the auto market could get by with a Camry/Accord/Sonata with a 4 cylinder and automatic. In my case those cars would be extremely unsafe; if I had to drive one every day I'd die of boredom. :P IMHO anything other than a basic mid-size car or wagon or minivan/people mover is all about convincing the world of what you want them to think of you.

Subaru sales have been going up at a healthy rate for some time, even in this brave new world economy, undoubtedly some find the cars appealing in more than simple practical ways. Well if Subarus are ""trendy"" then I feel bad for them. That means their sales will go drop once people move onto the next trend. If you want to say they've become more popular that's fine. But IMHO, they aren't trendy.My take earlier was to say that the vast majority of us don't buy a vehicle for simple reasons. Most - including myself - drive a car for what we want it to say about us. With cars, it's been that way since the 30's when GM started to come out with new models every year and create a marketing driven auto industry. If they hadn't we'd still be driving around in some variation of the Model T.Although you like to look down upon Lexus buyers, your E55 and fintail were chosen to poject to the world what you want it to think about you - even if you don't know it yourself. My Odyssey was chosen because it projects stability and quality. My VW Passat shows that I the quality of German engineering but enjoy the value of the VW vis a vis an Audi.

When someone I know who bought a Subaru wanted to put a ski rack on it just for the look, I had to think a little.I look at the condition of a car saying at least as much about the driver as the car itself, maybe more. A filthy new highline car says many things, as does a pristine 20 year old normal model. No digs being made, certainly not one of our beloved 1%. Many people do buy a car as an appliance that says nothing. I don't think my mother bought an appliance white Camry to say anything about herself. I don't know if I want to know what the general population thinks of my cars, but I don't really care either. Nor does or should a Lexus devotee care what I think. "

Several Ford stylists jumped ship to Mopar a few years before Iacocca went over, so as a result, a lot of Ford and Mopar products have a lot of similar styling features. Both tended to have bold, crisp, angular designs, whereas the GM cars of the era tended to be a bit more rounded off.GM would start making their cars a bit crisper with styles such as the re-skinned 1980 full-sized cars and the 1981 personal luxury coupes (Monte Carlo et al), but they were still a bit more rounded than the Fords and Mopars.

It needs the proper factory wire wheel covers or alloys (if they were available on the New Yorker; not sure of that) and whitewalls. You're right, but I gotta confess, I'm just as guilty.

This car's due for new tires soon, so I'm thinking about waiting until then. The front tires don't have many miles on them, but are about 10 years old. The back tires, which are on 15x7 copcar wheels, date back to February 1999, and came off my '89 Gran Fury. They're pretty worn down, too, so driving in slick weather can be a bit of an adventure! :surprise:Oh, I just looked online, and it looks like that road wheel that the other NYer is sporting was available as an option. Here's a page from the 1979 New Yorker brochure. It reminds me a little bit of the rally wheels that are on my '85 Silverado, although not nearly as beefy. My truck has 15x8 wheels, but I think these New Yorker wheels were only 15x6. FWIW, the wheels I have on the car now are 15x7 all around, although the copcar wheels on back are offset more, so they give the car a more stable, less tipsy posture. I'm pretty sure the Mirada wheels are 15x7 as well. "

I like tech too, esp direct injection, which is one reason you don't see me mocking Hyundai tech - they are forcing the mainstream to keep modernizing.So you have no brand preferences at all?

I don't remember this being such an issue in the past. In 2 months my new Regal has already taken 3 direct hits and has 2 divots. Fortunately no cracks yet.

"ateixeira","December 2011"," I picked a 98 Forester over Honda and Toyota options because the Subaru's engine actually had torque. :P The Jeep Cherokee was antique and trucky, plus my dad's fell apart, so no way. The Zook/Chevy Tracker was narrow and weak, and had zero appeal. Wasn't much else in the class at the time. Ford had not launched the Escape yet, and when they did they had funny recalls with steering wheels falling off and wheel studs breaking off. I prefer for the wheels to stay on the vehicle, thanks. Edmunds Live event (in 2000) actually had to park their Escapes, so I wasn't even able to sample it.Forester won on merit, and was my first new Japanese car, actually.Got a used NA Miata, no explanation necessary. You can't exactly daily drive an old Alfa or MG.My first top got old and cracked, so I replaced it. Then the 2nd top was vandalized. I was done with soft tops, but I still wanted a roadster.I actually looked at the Solistice but the top system was just LOL bad, you had to get out of the car to take the top down and it ate up the entire trunk. Worst top design in history!Tried a G6 convertible but structure was creaky and weak. Also tried PT Cruiser (don't ask). Rented a Sebring and it also had one single good feature, a big back seat. Did not drive a Solara due to reading posts from biased people like you that convinced me it would be way too soft.So my one bias that prevented a test drive was against Toyota. Ironic, eh?VW Eos dropped off my list when I read the VW threads and found it was the least-respected German car among fans of German cars.The Volvo C70 cost too much new, and I wasn't buying a Volvo out of warranty after friends dropped 4 figures at a time to fix little broken things like sensors. Never mind big things.So I got a new Miata. 2nd choice was ""keeping the old Miata"". There was no #2. I would not have turned down an SLK320 manual, but they're rare and I wanted a new car.Then came time for a minivan. Dodge was still selling the old GC at the time, the rear windows didn't even open. Simply not a contender.I drove the Kia but that was still the old Kia. Overweight, old engine tech, horrible gas mileage, pre-Schreyer design. If I was poor a $19k base model was acceptable. Good thing I'm not poor. FWIW I loved Kia's concept for a replacement. Let's see their next van.So it was Honda vs. Toyota. The whole family went, Toyota won 3 to 1, one of the kids preferred the Honda, everyone else voted Sienna.In each case it was purely based on merit, 3 different brands. The Sienna is made in the USA, but that wasn't really a factor, to be honest.And to come full circle and get us back on topic, I bought mine before the popular Swagger Wagon commercial went viral, now at 10 million hits and counting:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-N3F1FhW4 "

Dodge still needs work on the interior but they're getting there. Quest is a bit off for me, especially the SUV-like interior. People buy minivans for the minivan interior, why give that one primary advantage up?So if my van were totalled today, I do not really have a 1st choice. Hopefully Kia will step up. "

Lot's more kids can afford an Imprezza. "

I'd take that over any test-tube woodgrain, ever (although in the Caprice it was used in addition to fake woodgrain).I know I'm an older guy, but I also like brushed metal if done right.

A 2002 car in 2012 often looks modern and the average non-enthusiast probably has no idea it isn't newer.The color ideal is a valid point, powertrains and bodystyles too. Look at how many variants you could derive from an Impala or Galaxie in the mid 60s. You can still get lots of different color options - but only in highline cars. I will also say this when looking at my cars - the modern car has near supercar performance, is quiet at speed, smooth, reliable, needs no special maintenance, gets better mileage than the old car, and has a lot of cosseting features.

Then, as a parting screw up, they did that bit where they decided Olds was going to be their import fighter will all the new designs (which to my eye were actually quite attractive and still hold up today) with the same mechanicals underneath. The import folks weren't biting and there was nothing left for the traditional Oldsmobile buyer to relate to. It was sad to see that happen.That said, I agree with uplander that one mid-level brand is enough. Certainly no one else had more than one after the grand Edsel experiment.

However, I was already planning to buy a BMW as soon as possible after Grad School(Munich and Max Hoffman set the hook back in the early '70s with their print ads touting the 2002 and Bavaria, which would cruise at 100 and 120 mph respectively). That said, I was hearing good things about the 3rd Generation F-Bodies so I was leaving the door for American Iron cracked open a bit. Then I saw two TV commercials almost back to back.The first was for a 1979 Z28. It attempted to capitalize on the IROC series and it featured a stock Z weaving in and out of a bunch of IROC Camaros parked on a starting grid at a race track. The thing was, the Camaro was being driven at walking speed- my mother drove faster than that. Yawn.The next ad was for an E21 3er. Filmed at the N?rburgring, it was a bumper level shot from a lead car that focused on the 320iS chasing it. Both cars were moving- just hammering through the corners- including the Karussell. That was all it took(well, it didn't help that the 1982 Z28 was a joke). In 1983 I bought a Bavaria 3.0 and I haven't looked back since. "

"robr2","March 2012"," I was shocked that Nissan would drop the equity they had in the name at the time. Never got why. Well the brand was always Nissan for cars and Datsun for trucks in Japan.

But Nissan was always to corporate name here in the US.In the 70's they started labeling their vehicles ""Datsun by Nissan"". It was 1982 when they actually started to market the Nissan name and it was 1984 before they dropped Datsun altogether. The reason for changing the name was to have a world known brand name. ROW had changed to Nissan years earlier and Nissan was a bit jealous that Honda and Toyota had known corporate names and they didn't. "

"fintail","June 2012"," Many cars can fit that description, pretty much the entire crossover class, not to mention many SUVs and so-called sporty cars. Maybe cars without style (Equus, Camry) are immune. "
"ateixeira","June 2012"," Poor visibility, less space?I challenge you to find a vehicle with better visibility than our Forester. And it's much roomier than a WRX wagon.You won't beat the visibility unless you're in a convertible with the top down. And you won't beat the cargo space unless you're towing a trailer.So maybe a Cross Cabrio pulling a trailer, but that's about it. And who would want to drive that? Perhaps the Forester is the exception, as many crossovers go in the X6's direction. The original CR-V and Escape were also boxy, with great cargo space and visibility. Less so now. "
"fintail","June 2012"," Most crossovers have, as a segment, become less practical and more obese than the wagons they replaced. Your Forester is an anomaly which is aped by virtually no competitors, and it is not the most modern design either.Style over substance pretty much defines the class.Speaking of dumb commercials, the Acura ILX ""office"" commercial is lame, mostly because the car is lame. "
"ateixeira","June 2012"," That's a more recent trend.The Forester was a lot roomier than the Impreza wagon.The CR-V was a lot bigger than the Civic Wag-o-van it essentially replaced.The Focus wagon may have been bigger than the Escape, though, not sure.The RAV4 is a lot bigger than the Corolla wagon (Fielder overseas).Only the wagons based on bigger cars offered more room (Accord and Camry wagon for instance).Even then, you could argue the Pilot and Highlander replaced those, and they're far bigger as well.The trend is toward style, a la Evoque, but not all crossovers are impractical. "
"fintail","June 2012"," Did those really replace the wagons you mention though, or just wagons in general? In this market, those you list either have many year gaps between the wagon and higher riding estrogen infused mommymobile, or even concurrent sales. They offer greater profit margins, which is why the marketing side embraced them, giving them the masquerade of style to people who think a Corolla is nifty. Not all crossovers are impractical, but most require sacrifices that are not worth the gain unless you just have to sit a little higher and pretend to be rugged and capable. "
"ateixeira","June 2012"," Most of those were introduced right around the time the wagons were phased out. The Civic Wag-o-van even had the Real-Time 4WD logo on it.Subaru dropped the Loyale wagon. The Impreza ""wagon"" was really a 5 door hatch, the Forester was essentially the wagon. It grew taller over the years.I know you dislike the class overall, but the fact is many are quite practical, roomy, have great visibility, and offer a high vantage point which probably appeals to the often female demographic that buys them.Just because they don't serve you doesn't mean they don't serve a purpose to someone else. It's much easier to fit a child seat in a CR-V than in a low Civic or Accord. The AWD is for honest all-season use, not off road use.To me that's better than pitching XTerras to soccer moms with extreme rock climbing commercials. They were buying the wrong type of vehicle for them. Crossovers are better suited to their needs than 4x4s ever were.Would you really rather see soccer moms driving Jeeps and XTerras? Not me. "

Child seats are kind of a stretch too - how many of them are actually fitted with these? People like to pretend to be rough and adventurous.

I am the one who puts on, takes off snow tires, puts on summer tires. Have used torque wrenches for many years to tighten lugs to spec.

Have known the Service Manager for many years. Talked to him. First asked how they check brake pads. He said they look at wheels on one side. Ah hah. Told him what I found. He apologized and said they ONLY use torque wrenches, do by hand. Showed me torque wrenches at various mechanic work stations.

The SkyActiv model is the most fun you can have in the 40mpg club, per Autoweek, an enthusiast leaning magazine with expensive tastes. They cruised at over 70mph and still managed over 40mpg, too, so real world mileage and fun.Even the CX9, for its class, is best in class to drive, again compared to Highlander, Traverse, Pilot, Explorer, etc.All things being relative, of course, zoom zoom actually has some meaning.

"benjaminh","September 2012"," http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3dr8XFQr4k Imho this is a good commercial. It's corny, yes, but it works. It practically reduced my wife to tears and made her hug me and the dog. I think you can see why it's good by comparing and contrasting it with an ad for the new Nissan Altima that I've seen a lot. The Altima ad is good enough. It shows the car in a blank white room being digitally exploded and re-imagined and rebuilt as a better car. Fine. But what does that say about how we actually live with and use a car in daily life? Not much. The Honda Accord ad shows how cars are part of the fabric of our daily lives. Life is good but at the same time sometimes complicated and messy. The wet dog may shake off on the back seat. You might use the car for a nap at some point when you're really tired. You want the car to protect you and your loved ones, etc. But it's much more about real life than most car ads. Life isn't perfect, but in the middle of that you can rely on your Accord like a rock. I think it's one of the best car ads I've seen in a while. Is there a chance it's a little too corny and emotional, esp. for men? Yeah, maybe. But I think it breaks through the clutter and actually makes you pay attention. The length&#151;at 1.5 minutes&#151;is also daring. But interestingly Honda has also made 30 second and even 15 second ads with the same cast of characters that also work well. Clearly Honda's ad company worked to bring their A game to this ad....At least imho. Your results will vary. "

The much smaller GLK actually matches the 54.7 cubic foot capacity exactly. Coincidence.The shape is different, a box basically, rather than a long floor with a low ceiling, but you can always stack boxes.I'm not even a fan of the GLK, but you see how practical a small crossover can be. It is more than 16 inches (!) shorter overall than the CLS wagon yet matches the capacity, which supports my ""crossovers are practical"" theory quite well. :shades: "
"fintail","September 2012"," But the CLS would be bought for sporty looks. The GLK for rugged looks. I doubt either buyer thinks much about practicality. Image is everything.I'd take an E63 wagon over either, sleeper looks and good outward visibility. "
"ateixeira","September 2012"," GLK doesn't even look all that rugged.I think, perhaps unintentionally, they created a very practical small wagon, one that just happens to be tall and has decent clearance.You're probably right, though, from the consumers' point of view they probably see it as ""safe"" and just enjoy their truck's high point of view.E63 wagon for me, too.Had a C240 4Matic loaner once, liked it but I'd like something juuuust a smidge roomier.

"fintail","October 2012"," You're the underdog lover, even said it yourself. Why else would you be offended so dearly?Tech and lack of driving involvement, that does sound like Lexus.

"ateixeira","October 2012"," Yes, I like an underdog, but that's not what is going on here.Suzuki is an underdog. Kizashi is a very decent sedan you can still get with a manual that noone even knows about. They will fail and exit the US market within 2 years, sadly.This case is the opposite. People almost seem offended by Toyota's success. Must be because they target the type of female in those GLK ads, you and lemko conclude.Funny. On many levels. "
"fintail","October 2012"," Would you buy a Kizashi though? Reminds me of Saab - everyone loves them until it's time to open the wallet. Suzuki is even worse than an underdog, it seems the parent company wants them to fail here.I think Toyota offends car enthusiasts because it relied on beige lowest common denominator sleds for success for so many years. Add some of the Lexus counterpart to that - badge snobs in isotanks who claim not to be badge snobs, then add in the designer handbag on wheels, and there will be mocking. Deal with it :shades: "

I bet we'll hear in in 2015, when the 2012s go to the CPO market.Lexus had no soul to begin with.The Germans are the ones selling out right now. "
"fintail","October 2012"," So, no Suzuki. Bad corporate planning has doomed them. At least some of the bikes are still decent.Sounds like you list some BMW issues. I've never owned one of those. And if anything, it sounds like they are just devolving to Lexus-like standards in order to woo affluent (read: boring) diverse customers.MB: moderate steering feel, not sporty - historical standard. Always had a heavy throttle too. No self parking that I have seen. All cars are heavier and loaded. Generally boring wheels. No auto start/stop. So nothing for me to complain about other than weight and bulk (and price). In 2015, I'll probably have my current car, unless I find a huge deal. "

"fintail","October 2012"," Oh yeah, I forgot about that incident. Bad omen. On MB, it is throttle weight as much as travel. Going from the fintail to a W126 many years ago was a different world. The old car has a light pedal, as it has a revvy engine, and needs to rev to get moving. The tank though - like there was a brick under the pedal. E55 is kind of like that too. But - in a car like the E55 where passing 2K rpm makes you go too fast, it is kind of a mellow driving aid. I prefer it to a too light pedal. I remember my grandma had an Olds with a pedal that would shoot you forward with a cm of travel - then in typical 80s GM 6cyl fashion would run out of breath around 50mph. MB had the poorly thought out (and now seem to be gone) commercials that pretty much said ""I was dumb and my car saved me""...but isn't as loud about it as others. And I don't want to hear about empty FWD suits so long as the ES Supercamry exists  Maybe with potential future FWD cars, MB is chasing the boring retiree market that is soon to be a much larger part of sales.

"fushigi","October 2012"," Thanks. I've been too busy to really keep up with the auto show circuit and other developments. The video is a bit light on details but a cruising range of 880 kms (550 miles) would be nice. I hope for the NA market they move the plug to the driver front area; that would be more convenient for the average person who pulls into a garage.Granted it's all CG but if the shape is accurate it looks like Mitsu went over the design with an eye towards aero efficiency; surfaces seem a bit smoother than the current models. And the grill area is reminiscent of the pre-2010 design.It looks like the electrics will drive the front & rear wheels while the ICE will drive just the fronts. That should keep AWD complexity down on the hardware side (without really making the software that much more complex).http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMEuG2dhE_o&feature=relmfu has a few more details including some hints at the revised interior. Looks like they've kept the 3rd row but revised it. Also made the second row fold flat v. flip forward so cargo space should be improved.http://www.edmunds.com/auto-shows/paris/2012/2014-mitsubishi-outlander-plug-in-h- ybrid-for-us-2012-paris-auto-show.htmlI remain concerned about the price point.

They had a wet tarp and let you go out in a diesel RWD, then an E350 4Matic.The diesel exaggerated the traction problem because after a little lag the power comes on strong, and breaks traction easily. The result was jerky, like the car had hiccups, traction control cutting in.The AWD model was a smoother V6, back then pre-DI with less than 270hp, but linear power delivery. No problem on the slick tarp. "

Probably not one percenters. They can write a check for a new one or lease a new one. "
"fintail","October 2012"," Compared to RWD cars, FWD cars were amazing in snow, which is probably the reason FWD was touted as something superior in the 80s. My dad had a Horizon he also loved as a snow car. I suspect a modern AWD car could walk all over it, though. "
"fintail","October 2012"," There's more to driving a car than maintenance costs. Like I say, you gotta pay to play. There's no Honda sedan that comes anywhere close to my E55...If we all bought cars based on CR rankings, the motoring world would be painfully boring. "
"ateixeira","October 2012"," Wonder how linear the forced induction AMGs will be?I suspect the bigger engines will have enough torque that people won't complain.BMW's 535i felt lacking in response to me, as did the 328i. I can't imagine a 528i would be responsive.Once they get going and spool up, I'm sure they're fine, of course. "
"fintail","October 2012"," I suspect the modern turbo engines are also very linear and easy to drive to supercar speeds. Those engineers know what they are doing. People who aren't used to the driving experience just need to adjust to the heavy throttle. Torque can solve a lot of problems - for instance, why drivers of emasculated huge 70s V8s with puny hp outputs still felt fine behind the wheel - they moved along effortlessly. "
"ateixeira","October 2012"," Well, they are better tuned, but you still hit the throttle and wait, wait, and then get more than you wanted. Maybe you just have to train yourself to be more patient. I just don't want to.The Miata is ultra responsive. I can control speeds in tiny increments, even ""brake"" by reducing throttle position. Makes it very easy to position the car exactly where you want it.Of course the next Miata may be a small displacement turbo, what's the rumor? 1.4T maybe?Doubt I'll like it as much. "

He has a recent 3 series coupe with all-seasons on it. He struggled up our uphill winding paved driveway many times sliding off. He was persistent, kept backing up trying over and over, finally got to the top.On the other hand, we have no problem getting up our driveway in winter with our front drivers and snow tires mounted. Of course do not even try going up the driveway if fresh snowfall is higher than our vehicles' ground clearance. "

"fintail","October 2012"," My normally aspirated car isn't like that. It just requires more pressure than a normal car. But the response is like any other high torque engine - the more you press, the more you get. There's no point like in a VTEC car where it explodes after a certain RPM, or like a low tech V6 where it runs out of breath after 4500. It just keeps going and going - 100-120-140 and so on. It is easy to drive smooth or hard, as there is no magical take up point where things change. "

And still today in 2012.Our State allowed studded snows for a handful of years. Put them on our RWD cars at 4 corners and the traction and handling in snow and ice was amazing compared to just plain snows. Of course, the studs ripped up the pavement and the State then banned use of these.Downside to studded snows was on dry pavement at speed on interstate. Handling and feel was compromised quite a bit and with sustained speed, studs tended to fly out after some thousands of miles on the tires.Ultimate setup, if still allowed in any State, would be studded snows at 4 corners on an AWD such as Subaru or Audi.

"robr2","December 2012"," Kids and other halves will do that to youOh I know that!! I remember when we got the Odyssey back in 2000. A good friend remarked ""wow - what a cool minivan.""I actually drove that van with a bit of pride. I was and am still quite secure in my skin and the van was a badge of honor. Heck, when I got the Passat I was excited about having a station wagon as well. It was bought with kids in mind as well. Lacrosse bags and d-poles take up too much space in a sedan. "
"fintail","December 2012"," I might not be the market, but I have nothing against minivans. I like them more than pretend-tough CUVs or bloated SUVs - as they make few pretensions. They are haulers.When I was in school, I participated in hockey - could fit 4 guys and all gear in the fintail, but some sticks would run from front to back between the seats. "
"robr2","December 2012"," I like them more than pretend-tough CUVs or bloated SUVs - as they make few pretensions. They are haulers.Since we now have an Explorer in addition to the Odyssey, I can say that the van has more efficient packaging than the CUV. Yes CUV's are sold partly on image but then again so are luxury/performance cars. Driving an E63 AMG as a daily commuter in stop and go traffic is no different than doing the same thing in a Tahoe. 99% of those vehicles will never be used for what they are intended. They are bought and driven to convey an image. "
"fintail","December 2012"," Of course, the normal sized car is much less of an annoyance or hazard to surrounding vehicles as something as bloated as a Tahoe, too. Doesn't block view, is much less likely to kill people in a normal car if the driver runs a light, doesn't suck down as much fuel, isn't a problem in parking garages, etc. A far greater percentage of performance cars are sunny day drivers rather than commuter grinders too, no doubt. I'd rather drive on roads full of high performance cars (or minivans, or penalty box cheap cars, eyc) than on roads full of tall ""utility"" vehicles.Ideally, the really big models would require license endorsements. "
"xrunner2","December 2012"," Since we now have an Explorer in addition to the Odyssey, I can say that the van has more efficient packaging than the CUV. Had a Suburban for about 14 years and now an Ody for 12 years. Had these side-by-side for about 3 years. Moved a lot of stuff, things in each of these. Unless one is towing a trailer, there is no need for the added weight, poorer gas mileage and higher cost of a Suburban.Wife and I helped move some relatives at two different times using both the ODY and Suburban taking loads. The ODY very clearly has the greater hauling capacity. It also rides and handles better than the Suburban. "

With discounts and rebates, figure another grand or so off.I prefer the LTZ trim level myself, which starts to nudge $20K.With the average vehicle transaction now in excess of $30K, you could get a pretty decent car and a bike for that amount.I'm hoping the Fiesta ST comes in with a sticker in the low 20's.

Start/stop on that thing shakes the whole car.We may be a generation or so away from then tuning in more smoothness, but even then the instant throttle response won't quite be there. I just remember a short autocross course in a 330i and how you could use the throttle to accelerate and even slow gradually (engine compression) to get through the course, with a RIGHT-NOW response to that throttle that you just can't get from the new engine.When big engines are gone we'll still be nostalgic for larger displacement engines.We'll also miss hydraulic power steering when they're all electric. Heck, Miata owners complain that the no power assist option is gone!  "

Or another commercial for a BMW sliding around on beach, ripping it up and throwing up sand.

"fintail","February 2013"," I find the term ""consideration"" to be misleading and kind of self-aggrandizing, but I realize that's what marketing departments are all about. Simply googling something isn't ""considering"" it. Today I looked up a Kia Sorento - not something I would ever ""consider"" buying, though. If I see a new Genesis in traffic and turn my head to look at it, I am not necessarily ""considering"" it.As you say, to justify the spending, and no doubt the salaries and swag that come along with. Introducing a new model (CLA) might not be apples to apples re: touting an existing model, either. "
"stever","February 2013"," People aren't just googling vehicles. They are actually making the effort to go to Edmunds or AutoTrader and researching the vehicle they saw in the ad. That means reading the reviews and pricing them. And lots more were doing that after the commercial than had the previous month of Sundays. "
"fintail","February 2013"," IMO, simply checking a price on edmunds or autotrader the same as a google, just not as efficient. Not much real consideration going on, just marketing/advertising people justifying their budgets. When the hot model Genesis takes off in sales, I might re-""consider"" :shades: "
"stever","February 2013"," That wasn't the proposition.If you are selling something you have to keep your name in front of potential buyers.

"fintail","February 2013"," Oh, so what is the proposition then? Years? By then, the advertised car will have changed or might not even exist at all. Still don't buy the ""consideration"" term. ""Curiosity"" might be more accurate - but it sounds less severe and would gain less money from the accountants.Regarding the pricing, there's a lot of ego and prestige in having a product aired during that game, too.

"fintail","February 2013"," Yes, it can bring in money to keep paychecks flowing :shades: Just a semantic thing, I guess. I see ""consideration"" as ""considering"" something.

"ateixeira","March 2013"," I think this is the last model year. Don't quote me but we may get a preview at the NY show in April.I bet they spoil it by over styling it and raising the price.

"fintail","March 2013"," Oh yeah, they will overstyle it. It might even be a reaction to the current somewhat understyled E60-derived design - and I am not saying understyled is bad. Raising the price could be a dangerous game, but it might also finally empty a slot for the Azera, which is in a tough position right now. "

"stickguy","March 2013"," the Azera really serves a different purpose (market niche) even though it is similar in size and price. I look at it as similar to Lexus with the ES and GS.I remember when the genny was coming out, my friend that works for corporate (so I got to see all the new models 3-4 months before they were in the dealers) had one, and he told me that he preferred the Azera, because it was a more cushy ride. So, appealing to the older (Buick/Avalon) set instead of the younger, ""euro"" crowd. "
"ab348","March 2013"," Well, it's cheap. It may be no bargain though. Long-term quality in Hyundais still seems to be a crapshoot. "
"ateixeira","March 2013"," Azera is in the 30s I think, but it only comes loaded. Edit: 29.5 to 35 or so.There's still plenty of room below the E and 5. They can find a sweet spot in the 40-45k range. "
"fintail","March 2013"," I'd wager 95% of Genesis transaction prices are no more than in the 30s, and Sonata can creep up close when loaded.

Clearing out inventory no doubt. "
"ateixeira","March 2013"," Took a peek, there's way too much overlap. Pretty much starts at a grand more than the Azera, and median price is about where the Azera leaves off, so 50% overlap. The 5l V8 peeks in to the low 40s. 10% of them were in the 40s (you were close).Drop the base V6, make the premium package standard, and they would not overlap.No way no how I'd ever pick an Azera over a Genesis.The only Sonatas in the $30s are the hybrids, so that model is about where it should be. If we exclude the hybrid it doesn't overlap with the Azera at all.When the new Genny comes out the lineup should be sorted out in terms of price, with little/no overlap. "

"fintail","April 2013"," A couple commercials being aired a lot right now are kind of annoying. Any Honda ad with whistling style music in the background - seems to be a dorky ploy put people at ease, as if a car is so worrisome and stressful. Whistling makes troubles go away! And VW commercials featuring annoying early 30-somethings - guy has to have faux scruff (the last gasp of masculinity his owner allows) and a collared shirt with a sweater or similar. I think the ad copy business is ran by hipsters. "
"xrunner2","April 2013"," Would have thought VW would move on from their silly commercial of 3 guys out for a ride in a VW beetle convertible on a cold day with top down.

Yeah, but when your sugar comes in little brown cubes roughly the color of my 2000 Park Ave, instead of a a ten-pound bag that says ""Kirkland"" or ""Richfood"" on it...THAT's luxury! :P Funny thing is, I have a friend who's somewhat like that...with one exception. He's anything BUT car-conscious. He won't balk at paying $1,000 for a bike (my last bike came from WalMart about 14 years ago), and I doubt if it was $100), $100 for a dress shirt (I don't even know how much a dress shirt is ""supposed"" to cost, as I always get a few from my Mom and stepdad for Christmas, and she'll always buy them throughout the year, on sale, and then give them to me), buy the latest and greatest electronic crap on a whim, and so on. And, I don't know if it's ""luxury"", but I think his coffee maker was around $100 or so. We always buy the $20-25 model and when it breaks, to quote Eazy-E, say oh brutha, throw it in da gutter, and go buy anotha'. But, he doesn't even own a car.You can sort of get away with no car in DC though. Heck, you could get away with it out here once upon a time, but they shut our branch of the WB&A down back in 1935, pulled up all the track in 1939, and sold it to the Japanese.

Not only did we drive to Chicago, but we rented a car for a day in Seattle and have wheels available from friends at our next couple of stops.

"ab348","May 2016"," Well, the Granada was (I believe) the last variant of the old Falcon/Maverick/original Mustang platform to be produced by Ford. So it had the typical Ford slow, numb power steering, wallowy handling, terminal understeer, and poor chassis dynamics that most of those vehicles had back then.

No doubt Audi is shamelessly pandering to a demographic, but I would rather call out that bit alone.

They seem to be roughly 15-20% off MSRP, which IMO is too high for a prior year model in late May of the following year. ","ab348 said:I'm not easily offended.

"imidazol97","February 2019"," Commercials have to be analyzed thinking about what the purpose may be. Is the commercial trying to sell the truck or simply make people aware.

I suspect there are many households here where two vehicles are an SUV and pickup or two pickups. I think the Country/Rock & Roll ad is to grab attention from both types of music lovers, who may represent different age groups. I want to comment too that ads are intended to be different or grate a little bit as a way of making it memorable. Not ""memorable"" as in ""great commercial"" but memorable as in people think about it and remember it. Seeing as how the ""actors, not real people"" ads got people talking about them, I think they served their purpose.We've had car dealers who advertise in awful advertisements but get remembered when it's time to go shop.

I remember a Scion ad late in the brand's run was mocked at pandering to youth a little too hard. Brand wasn't behind it, lame advertising made it happen.""Real people"" was even worse though, as it made people who appeared to be wowed by Chevy look like morons.

"fintail","July 2020"," Saw a Toyota ad proclaiming the Prius is ""stylish"", and a Honda ad with the ""fun to drive"" CR-V. There has to be a case for a false advertising claim on this, right? "
"andres3","July 2020","  Unfortunately stylish and fun are subjective terms with relativity at play. I remember a woman praising the Murano as like a ""sports car"" in the twisties to Enterprise upon return, as no doubt she was used to something that handled even worse.

"nv1z","October 2020","  I have been looking for a copy of that ad on YouTube. ","pjyoung said:I laughed out loud at the ad where the family is in the SUV, with the wife driving. The husband announces with a smile ""I quit my job today"", then the teenage daughter pipes up with ""I met the coolest guy on the internet...he's 30"" and the youngest son said ""Hey mom, you remember that tattoo I was thinking about getting?"" All this time, a bunch of bottles are falling off the truck in front of them and the woman calmly steers around the obstacles."

"tmart","November 2020"," Hooray! The Lexus Christmas commercials are back along with the his and hers GMC one. Like the Lexus, can?t stand the GMC. "
"stickguy","November 2020"," They all are. Cheaping out too, using the same exact one. Not even updating the cars (the GMC his and hers ?I like red? didn?t change anything) "

"fintail","December 2020"," Pretty good parody - not up there with the Adobe, but that's unrepeatable. Even the showy mcmodern box house prop is on point for these spots. "

"ab348","December 2020"," That video is not available in Canada, strangely.I am getting more and more annoyed with the GMC Christmas couple commercials. I saw another one over the weekend and it showed this 30-something pair - I assumed them to be a senior entertainment industry exec of some sort and a dot-com tycoon - in a mega-millions modern architecture mansion, with of course a pair of new GMCs parked out front. I'm not sure if that image really matches up well with the GMC brand image. The couple looked like they would more likely be shopping at their local M-B/Bentley/Lambo dealer. "
"fintail","December 2020"," Is the GMC spot the ""his and hers"" headache? Two GMCs in front of the house, a full sized mallcruiser pickup and a CUV box. Couple is outside, one assumes the CUV is for her, but she goes to the pickup, and of course he just smiles or something. Whatever will the bros think back at the jobsite operated by uncle's greased palms contracting company, or at the office park?An RX with a bow on it in front of a mcmodern mansionette is just right on a few levels. "
"tmart","December 2020"," There?s another GMC one where hubby whistles and a cute puppy comes thru the snow for wifey. The wife whistles and a GMC pick up comes driving thru the snow for hubby! "
"ab348","December 2020","  I was so gobsmacked by the images of the property that I forget what the 2 vehicles were. This is different from the one I saw earlier in the month which I think was a carryover from last season, with a dark blue pickup and a red SUV.

"fintail","December 2020"," I'd wager a big 4 door pickup and something like a Terrain or Acadia. Putting a showy house in the ads probably works wonders in a culture that is weirdly more obsessed with housing than probably at any time in history. However, the cloned mcmodern is probably more likely to have a pair of white Teslas or Audis in the driveway.

"stickguy","December 2020"," Yeah, a loaded Denali PU and a Terrain (the little one?). Though at the close, they have an Acadia (the big one?) in place of the PU. And must not have had much budget since they used the same commercial as last year, and did not even swap in new cars.The house is cool though. Very modern and cool looking. "

"fintail","February 2021"," Yeah maybe trying a little hard - it seems every Xlennial, especially those with micromanaged devilspawn, wants a potato CUV/SUV or maybe a 4 door pickup for everyday use. Going to be a hard sell to put them behind the wheel of dad's sedan, even if the facelift has received pretty positive reviews (I am still bitter about the formal grille/hood ornament being dropped for the NA market) "
"tjc78","February 2021"," For us NJ shore people this is pretty cool.

"tjc78","February 2021"," We only went one time last year, but only walked the boards. No rides or anything. Will probably be the same this year. It?s a shame, the kids love the water parks. Wife and I both have decided we didn?t get to the beach as often as we should have considering we are down there every weekend. "
"tmart","November 2022"," I like the Kia Telluride commercial where they meet a donkey carrying white paint cans and farther up the mountain, men are painting the clouds. The driver says he thinks they went too high. "
